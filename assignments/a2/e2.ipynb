In particular, on spring-forward days, shifting forward by 2 hours from midnight is treated as being the same time as shifting 3 from midnight:\\r\\n```\\r\\nPython 3.10.12 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun 23 2023, 22:41:52) [Clang 15.0.7 ] on darwin\\r\\nType \\\"help\\\", \\\"copyright\\\", \\\"credits\\\" or \\\"license\\\" for more information.\\r\\n>>> import arrow\\r\\n>>> from datetime import datetime\\r\\n>>> x = arrow.get(datetime(2023, 3, 12), 'America/Los_Angeles')\\r\\n>>> x.shift(hours=3) == x.shift(hours=2)\\r\\nTrue\\r\\n>>> print(x.shift(hours=2))\\r\\n2023-03-12T03:00:00-07:00\\r\\n>>> print(x.shift(hours=3))\\r\\n2023-03-12T03:00:00-07:00\\r\\n```\\r\\nIt looks to me like shifting by 2 hours is correct, but that shifting 3 is not.  Perhaps this is the intended semantics of `shift`, but if that's the case then the following example seems inconsistent (shifting by 1 hour 3 times returns the result I expected for shifting 3 hours once):\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> x.shift(hours=1).shift(hours=1).shift(hours=1)\\r\\n<Arrow [2023-03-12T04:00:00-07:00]>\\r\\n>>> x.shift(hours=1).shift(hours=1).shift(hours=1) == x.shift(hours=3) # I'd expect this to be true for any value of x\\r\\nFalse\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I try adding `timedelta(hours=1)` I  get different unintuitive behavior, this time when it comes to adding 1 hour or 2 hours:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> (x + timedelta(hours=1)).timestamp() == (x + timedelta(hours=2)).timestamp() # I'd expect this to be false\\r\\nTrue\\r\\n>>> x + timedelta(hours=1)\\r\\n<Arrow [2023-03-12T01:00:00-08:00]> # this looks right to me\\r\\n>>> x + timedelta(hours=2)\\r\\n<Arrow [2023-03-12T02:00:00-07:00]> # I think this should be 2023-03-12T03:00:00-07:00\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOn fall-behind days, there are also problems. In this case using both `shift` and adding a `timedelta` do the same thing : the gap between midnight offsetby 1 hour and offset by 2 hours is 7200 seconds (2 hours):\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> y = arrow.get(datetime(2023, 11, 5), 'America/Los_Angeles')\\r\\n>>> y.shift(hours=1)\\r\\n<Arrow [2023-11-05T01:00:00-07:00]>\\r\\n>>> y.shift(hours=2)\\r\\n<Arrow [2023-11-05T02:00:00-08:00]>\\r\\n>>> y.shift(hours=2).timestamp() - y.shift(hours=1).timestamp() # I'd expect 3600\\r\\n7200.0\\r\\n>>> (y + timedelta(hours=2)).timestamp() - (y + timedelta(hours=1)).timestamp() # I'd expect 3600\\r\\n7200.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## System Info\\r\\n\\r\\n- \\ud83d\\udda5  **OS name and version**: macOs 14.2.1\\r\\n- \\ud83d\\udc0d  **Python version**: 3.10.12\\u00a0\\r\\n- \\ud83c\\udff9  **Arrow version**: 1.3.0\\r\\n\",\n",
