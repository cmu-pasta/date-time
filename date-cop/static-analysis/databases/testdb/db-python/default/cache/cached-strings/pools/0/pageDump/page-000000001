    obj may be a callable, class, or module.
    Passing in an object of any other type raises TypeError.

    Returns a dict.  get_annotations() returns a new dict every time
    it's called; calling it twice on the same object will return two
    different but equivalent dicts.

    This function handles several details for you:

      * If eval_str is true, values of type str will
        be un-stringized using eval().  This is intended
        for use with stringized annotations
        ("from __future__ import annotations").
      * If obj doesn't have an annotations dict, returns an
        empty dict.  (Functions and methods always have an
        annotations dict; classes, modules, and other types of
        callables may not.)
      * Ignores inherited annotations on classes.  If a class
        doesn't have its own annotations dict, returns an empty dict.
      * All accesses to object members and dict values are done
        using getattr() and dict.get() for safety.
      * Always, always, always returns a freshly-created dict.

    eval_str controls whether or not values of type str are replaced
    with the result of calling eval() on those values:

      * If eval_str is true, eval() is called on values of type str.
      * If eval_str is false (the default), values of type str are unchanged.

    globals and locals are passed in to eval(); see the documentation
    for eval() for more information.  If either globals or locals is
    None, this function may replace that value with a context-specific
    default, contingent on type(obj):

      * If obj is a module, globals defaults to obj.__dict__.
      * If obj is a class, globals defaults to
        sys.modules[obj.__module__].__dict__ and locals
        defaults to the obj class namespace.
      * If obj is a callable, globals defaults to obj.__globals__,
        although if obj is a wrapped function (using
        functools.update_wrapper()) it is first unwrapped.

    But not if ismethod() or isclass() or isfunction() are true.

    This is new in Python 2.2, and, for example, is true of int.__add__.
    An object passing this test has a __get__ attribute but not a __set__
    attribute, but beyond that the set of attributes varies.  __name__ is
    usually sensible, and __doc__ often is.

    Methods implemented via descriptors that also pass one of the other
    tests return false from the ismethoddescriptor() test, simply because
    the other tests promise more -- you can, e.g., count on having the
    __func__ attribute (etc) when an object passes ismethod().''Return true if the object is a data descriptor.

    Data descriptors have a __set__ or a __delete__ attribute.  Examples are
    properties (defined in Python) and getsets and members (defined in C).
    Typically, data descriptors will also have __name__ and __doc__ attributes
    (properties, getsets, and members have both of these attributes), but this
    is not guaranteed.''Return true if the object is a member descriptor.

The
builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

data:

DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE

   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
   I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
   possible.

        All test modules must be importable from the top level of the project.

        the package has already had load_tests called from the same discovery
        invocation, in which case the package module object is not scanned for

        discover child tests that infinite recursion does not happen.

        If load_tests exists then discovery does *not* recurse into the package,
        load_tests is responsible for loading all tests in the package.

        The pattern is deliberately not stored as a loader attribute so that

        name.

        The returned locale code is formatted for use with
        setlocale().

        If normalization fails, the original name is returned
        unchanged.

        If the given encoding is not known, the function defaults to
        the default encoding for the locale code just like setlocale()
        does.

    '' Parses the locale code for localename and returns the
        result as tuple (language code, encoding).

        The localename is normalized and passed through the locale
        alias engine. A ValueError is raised in case the locale name
        cannot be parsed.

        The language code corresponds to RFC 1766.  code and encoding
        can be None in case the values cannot be determined or are
        unknown to this implementation.

    ''unknown locale: %s'' Builds a locale code from the given tuple (language code,
        encoding).

        No aliasing or normalizing takes place.

    ''Locale must be None, a string, or an iterable of two strings -- language code, encoding.'' Tries to determine the default locale settings and returns
        them as tuple (language code, encoding).

        According to POSIX, a program which has not called
        setlocale(LC_ALL, "") runs using the portable 'C' locale.
        Calling setlocale(LC_ALL, "") lets it use the default locale as
        defined by the LANG variable. Since we don't want to interfere
        with the current locale setting we thus emulate the behavior
        in the way described above.

        To maintain compatibility with other platforms, not only the
        LANG variable is tested, but a list of variables given as
        envvars parameter. The first found to be defined will be
        used. envvars defaults to the search path used in GNU gettext;
        it must always contain the variable name 'LANG'.

        Except for the code 'C', the language code corresponds to RFC
        1766.  code and encoding can be None in case the values cannot
        be determined.

    ''locale.getdefaultlocale''{name!r} is deprecated and slated for removal in Python {remove}. Use setlocale(), getencoding() and getlocale() instead.''0x'' Returns the current setting for the given locale category as
        tuple (language code, encoding).

        category may be one of the LC_* value except LC_ALL. It
        defaults to LC_CTYPE.

        Except for the code 'C', the language code corresponds to RFC
        1766.  code and encoding can be None in case the values cannot
        be determined.

    ''category LC_ALL is not supported'' Set the locale for the given category.  The locale can be
        a string, an iterable of two strings (language code and encoding),
        or None.

        Iterables are converted to strings using the locale aliasing
        engine.  Locale strings are passed directly to the C lib.

        category may be given as one of the LC_* values.

    '' Sets the locale for category to the default setting.

        The default setting is determined by calling
        getdefaultlocale(). category defaults to LC_ALL.

    A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned
    by a particular coroutine when locked.  A primitive lock is in one
    of two states, 'locked' or 'unlocked'.

    It is created in the unlocked state.  It has two basic methods,
    acquire() and release().  When the state is unlocked, acquire()
    changes the state to locked and returns immediately.  When the
    state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to release() in
    another coroutine changes it to unlocked, then the acquire() call
    resets it to locked and returns.  The release() method should only
    be called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked
    and returns immediately.  If an attempt is made to release an
    unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised.

    When more than one coroutine is blocked in acquire() waiting for
    the state to turn to unlocked, only one coroutine proceeds when a
    release() call resets the state to unlocked; first coroutine which
    is blocked in acquire() is being processed.

    acquire() is a coroutine and should be called with 'await'.

    Locks also support the asynchronous context management protocol.
    'async with lock' statement should be used.

    Usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        await lock.acquire()
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            lock.release()

    Context manager usage:

        lock = Lock()
        ...
        async with lock:
             ...

    Lock objects can be tested for locking state:

        if not lock.locked():
           await lock.acquire()
        else:
           # lock is acquired
           ...

    ''unlocked'', waiters:'']>''Return True if lock is acquired.''Acquire a lock.

        This method blocks until the lock is unlocked, then sets it to
        locked and returns True.
        ''Release a lock.

        When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return.
        If any other coroutines are blocked waiting for the lock to become
        unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed.

        When invoked on an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError is raised.

        There is no return value.
        ''Lock is not acquired.''Wake up the first waiter if it isn't done.''Asynchronous equivalent to threading.Event.

    Class implementing event objects. An event manages a flag that can be set
    to true with the set() method and reset to false with the clear() method.
    The wait() method blocks until the flag is true. The flag is initially
    false.
    ''unset''Return True if and only if the internal flag is true.''Set the internal flag to true. All coroutines waiting for it to
        become true are awakened. Coroutine that call wait() once the flag is
        true will not block at all.
        ''Reset the internal flag to false. Subsequently, coroutines calling
        wait() will block until set() is called to set the internal flag
        to true again.''Block until the internal flag is true.

        If the internal flag is true on entry, return True
        immediately.  Otherwise, block until another coroutine calls

        ''Asynchronous equivalent to threading.Condition.

    This class implements condition variable objects. A condition variable
    allows one or more coroutines to wait until they are notified by another
    coroutine.

    A new Lock object is created and used as the underlying lock.
    ''Wait until notified.

        If the calling coroutine has not acquired the lock when this
        method is called, a RuntimeError is raised.

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks
        until it is awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call for
        the same condition variable in another coroutine.  Once
        awakened, it re-acquires the lock and returns True.
        ''cannot wait on un-acquired lock''wait_for''Wait until a predicate becomes true.

        The predicate should be a callable which result will be
        interpreted as a boolean value.  The final predicate value is
        the return value.
        ''By default, wake up one coroutine waiting on this condition, if any.
        If the calling coroutine has not acquired the lock when this method
        is called, a RuntimeError is raised.

        This method wakes up at most n of the coroutines waiting for the
        condition variable; it is a no-op if no coroutines are waiting.

        Note: an awakened coroutine does not actually return from its
        wait() call until it can reacquire the lock. Since notify() does
        not release the lock, its caller should.
        ''cannot notify on un-acquired lock''Wake up all threads waiting on this condition. This method acts
        like notify(), but wakes up all waiting threads instead of one. If the
        calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is called,
        a RuntimeError is raised.
        ''A Semaphore implementation.

    A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
    acquire() call and incremented by each release() call. The counter
    can never go below zero; when acquire() finds that it is zero, it blocks,
    waiting until some other thread calls release().

    Semaphores also support the context management protocol.

    The optional argument gives the initial value for the internal
    counter; it defaults to 1. If the value given is less than 0,
    ValueError is raised.
    ''Semaphore initial value must be >= 0''unlocked, value:''Returns True if semaphore cannot be acquired immediately.''Acquire a semaphore.

        If the internal counter is larger than zero on entry,
        decrement it by one and return True immediately.  If it is
        zero on entry, block, waiting until some other coroutine has
        called release() to make it larger than 0, and then return
        True.
        ''Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.

        become larger than zero again, wake up that coroutine.

    Implements a Barrier primitive.
    Useful for synchronizing a fixed number of tasks at known synchronization

    ''Create a barrier, initialised to 'parties' tasks.''parties must be > 0''Wait for the barrier.

This module provides a class for reading and writing compressed files,
classes for incremental (de)compression, and convenience functions for
one-shot (de)compression.

These classes and functions support both the XZ and legacy LZMA
container formats, as well as raw compressed data streams.

    An LZMAFile can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or
    refer directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that LZMAFile provides a *binary* file interface - data read
    is returned as bytes, and data to be written must be given as bytes.
    ''Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary mode.

        filename can be either an actual file name (given as a str,
        bytes, or PathLike object), in which case the named file is
        opened, or it can be an existing file object to read from or
        write to.

        mode can be "r" for reading (default), "w" for (over)writing,
        "x" for creating exclusively, or "a" for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as "rb", "wb", "xb" and "ab" respectively.

        format specifies the container format to use for the file.
        If mode is "r", this defaults to FORMAT_AUTO. Otherwise, the
        default is FORMAT_XZ.

        check specifies the integrity check to use. This argument can
        only be used when opening a file for writing. For FORMAT_XZ,
        the default is CHECK_CRC64. FORMAT_ALONE and FORMAT_RAW do not
        support integrity checks - for these formats, check must be
        omitted, or be CHECK_NONE.

        When opening a file for reading, the *preset* argument is not
        meaningful, and should be omitted. The *filters* argument should
        also be omitted, except when format is FORMAT_RAW (in which case
        it is required).

        When opening a file for writing, the settings used by the
        compressor can be specified either as a preset compression
        level (with the *preset* argument), or in detail as a custom
        filter chain (with the *filters* argument). For FORMAT_XZ and
        FORMAT_ALONE, the default is to use the PRESET_DEFAULT preset
        level. For FORMAT_RAW, the caller must always specify a filter
        chain; the raw compressor does not support preset compression
        levels.

        preset (if provided) should be an integer in the range 0-9,
        optionally OR-ed with the constant PRESET_EXTREME.

        filters (if provided) should be a sequence of dicts. Each dict
        should have an entry for "id" indicating ID of the filter, plus
        additional entries for options to the filter.
        ''Cannot specify an integrity check when opening a file for reading''Cannot specify a preset compression level when opening a file for reading''Read up to size uncompressed bytes from the file.

        If size is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
        Returns b"" if the file is already at EOF.
        ''Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid
        making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a
        buffer's worth of data if size is negative.

        Returns b"" if the file is at EOF.
        ''Write a bytes object to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always the length of data in bytes. Note that due to buffering,
        the file on disk may not reflect the data written until close()
        is called.
        ''Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Possible values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default): offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        ''Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    filename can be either an actual file name (given as a str, bytes,
    or PathLike object), in which case the named file is opened, or it
    can be an existing file object to read from or write to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb" (default), "w", "wb", "x", "xb",
    "a", or "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt", or "at" for text
    mode.

    The format, check, preset and filters arguments specify the
    compression settings, as for LZMACompressor, LZMADecompressor and
    LZMAFile.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the LZMAFile
    constructor: LZMAFile(filename, mode, ...). In this case, the
    encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, an LZMAFile object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    ''Compress a block of data.

''Basic message object for the email package object model.''EmailMessage''[ \(\)<>@,;:\\"/\[\]\?=]''Convenience function to format and return a key=value pair.

    This will quote the value if needed or if quote is true.  If value is a
    three tuple (charset, language, value), it will be encoded according
    to RFC2231 rules.  If it contains non-ascii characters it will likewise
    be encoded according to RFC2231 rules, using the utf-8 charset and
    a null language.

''Basic message object.

    A message object is defined as something that has a bunch of RFC 2822
    headers and a payload.  It may optionally have an envelope header
    (a.k.a. Unix-From or From_ header).  If the message is a container (i.e. a
    multipart or a message/rfc822), then the payload is a list of Message
    objects, otherwise it is a string.

    Message objects implement part of the `mapping' interface, which assumes
    there is exactly one occurrence of the header per message.  Some headers
    do in fact appear multiple times (e.g. Received) and for those headers,
    you must use the explicit API to set or get all the headers.  Not all of
    the mapping methods are implemented.
    ''text/plain''Return the entire formatted message as a string.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a string.

        Optional 'unixfrom', when true, means include the Unix From_ envelope
        header.  For backward compatibility reasons, if maxheaderlen is
        not specified it defaults to 0, so you must override it explicitly
        if you want a different maxheaderlen.  'policy' is passed to the
        Generator instance used to serialize the message; if it is not
        specified the policy associated with the message instance is used.

        If the message object contains binary data that is not encoded
        according to RFC standards, the non-compliant data will be replaced by
        unicode "unknown character" code points.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a bytes object.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a bytes object.

        Optional 'unixfrom', when true, means include the Unix From_ envelope
        header.  'policy' is passed to the BytesGenerator instance used to
        serialize the message; if not specified the policy associated with
        the message instance is used.
        ''Return True if the message consists of multiple parts.''Add the given payload to the current payload.

        The current payload will always be a list of objects after this method
        is called.  If you want to set the payload to a scalar object, use
        set_payload() instead.
        ''Attach is not valid on a message with a non-multipart payload''Return a reference to the payload.

        The payload will either be a list object or a string.  If you mutate
        the list object, you modify the message's payload in place.  Optional
        i returns that index into the payload.

        Optional decode is a flag indicating whether the payload should be
        decoded or not, according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding header
        (default is False).

        When True and the message is not a multipart, the payload will be
        decoded if this header's value is `quoted-printable' or `base64'.  If
        some other encoding is used, or the header is missing, or if the
        payload has bogus data (i.e. bogus base64 or uuencoded data), the
        payload is returned as-is.

        If the message is a multipart and the decode flag is True, then None
        is returned.
        ''Expected list, got %s''x-uuencode''uuencode''uue''x-uue''Set the payload to the given value.

        Optional charset sets the message's default character set.  See
        set_charset() for details.
        ''Set the charset of the payload to a given character set.

        charset can be a Charset instance, a string naming a character set, or
        None.  If it is a string it will be converted to a Charset instance.
        If charset is None, the charset parameter will be removed from the
        Content-Type field.  Anything else will generate a TypeError.

        The message will be assumed to be of type text/* encoded with
        charset.input_charset.  It will be converted to charset.output_charset
        and encoded properly, if needed, when generating the plain text
        representation of the message.  MIME headers (MIME-Version,
        Content-Type, Content-Transfer-Encoding) will be added as needed.
        ''MIME-Version''Return the Charset instance associated with the message's payload.
        ''Return the total number of headers, including duplicates.''Get a header value.

        Return None if the header is missing instead of raising an exception.

        Note that if the header appeared multiple times, exactly which
        occurrence gets returned is undefined.  Use get_all() to get all
        the values matching a header field name.
        ''Set the value of a header.

        Note: this does not overwrite an existing header with the same field

        re-inserted are always appended to the header list.

        If no such fields exist, failobj is returned (defaults to None).
        ''Extended header setting.

        name is the header field to add.  keyword arguments can be used to set
        additional parameters for the header field, with underscores converted
        to dashes.  Normally the parameter will be added as key="value" unless
        value is None, in which case only the key will be added.  If a
        parameter value contains non-ASCII characters it can be specified as a
        three-tuple of (charset, language, value), in which case it will be
        encoded according to RFC2231 rules.  Otherwise it will be encoded using
        the utf-8 charset and a language of ''.

        Examples:

        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment',
                       filename=('utf-8', '', Fuballer.ppt'))
        msg.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment',
                       filename='Fuballer.ppt'))
        ''Replace a header.

        Replace the first matching header found in the message, retaining
        header order and case.  If no matching header was found, a KeyError is
        raised.
        ''Return the message's content type.

        The returned string is coerced to lower case of the form
        `maintype/subtype'.  If there was no Content-Type header in the
        message, the default type as given by get_default_type() will be
        returned.  Since according to RFC 2045, messages always have a default
        type this will always return a value.

        RFC 2045 defines a message's default type to be text/plain unless it
        appears inside a multipart/digest container, in which case it would be
        message/rfc822.
        ''Return the message's main content type.

        This is the `maintype' part of the string returned by
        get_content_type().
        ''Returns the message's sub-content type.

        This is the `subtype' part of the string returned by
        get_content_type().
        ''Return the `default' content type.

        Most messages have a default content type of text/plain, except for
        messages that are subparts of multipart/digest containers.  Such
        subparts have a default content type of message/rfc822.
        ''Set the `default' content type.

        ctype should be either "text/plain" or "message/rfc822", although this
        is not enforced.  The default content type is not stored in the
        Content-Type header.
        ''decode_params''Return the message's Content-Type parameters, as a list.

        The elements of the returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs, as
        split on the `=' sign.  The left hand side of the `=' is the key,
        while the right hand side is the value.  If there is no `=' sign in
        the parameter the value is the empty string.  The value is as
        described in the get_param() method.

        Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no Content-Type
        header.  Optional header is the header to search instead of
        Content-Type.  If unquote is True, the value is unquoted.
        ''Return the parameter value if found in the Content-Type header.

        Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no Content-Type
        header, or the Content-Type header has no such parameter.  Optional
        header is the header to search instead of Content-Type.

        Parameter keys are always compared case insensitively.  The return
        value can either be a string, or a 3-tuple if the parameter was RFC
        2231 encoded.  When it's a 3-tuple, the elements of the value are of
        the form (CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE).  Note that both CHARSET and
        LANGUAGE can be None, in which case you should consider VALUE to be
        encoded in the us-ascii charset.  You can usually ignore LANGUAGE.
        The parameter value (either the returned string, or the VALUE item in
        the 3-tuple) is always unquoted, unless unquote is set to False.

        If your application doesn't care whether the parameter was RFC 2231
        encoded, it can turn the return value into a string as follows:

            rawparam = msg.get_param('foo')
            param = email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value(rawparam)

        ''Set a parameter in the Content-Type header.

        If the parameter already exists in the header, its value will be
        replaced with the new value.

        If header is Content-Type and has not yet been defined for this
        message, it will be set to "text/plain" and the new parameter and
        value will be appended as per RFC 2045.

        An alternate header can be specified in the header argument, and all
        parameters will be quoted as necessary unless requote is False.

        If charset is specified, the parameter will be encoded according to RFC
        2231.  Optional language specifies the RFC 2231 language, defaulting
        to the empty string.  Both charset and language should be strings.
        ''Remove the given parameter completely from the Content-Type header.

        The header will be re-written in place without the parameter or its
        value. All values will be quoted as necessary unless requote is
        False.  Optional header specifies an alternative to the Content-Type
        header.
        ''Set the main type and subtype for the Content-Type header.

        type must be a string in the form "maintype/subtype", otherwise a
        ValueError is raised.

        This method replaces the Content-Type header, keeping all the
        parameters in place.  If requote is False, this leaves the existing
        header's quoting as is.  Otherwise, the parameters will be quoted (the
        default).

        An alternative header can be specified in the header argument.  When
        the Content-Type header is set, we'll always also add a MIME-Version
        header.
        ''mime-version''Return the filename associated with the payload if present.

        The filename is extracted from the Content-Disposition header's
        `filename' parameter, and it is unquoted.  If that header is missing
        the `filename' parameter, this method falls back to looking for the
        `name' parameter.
        ''content-disposition''collapse_rfc2231_value''Return the boundary associated with the payload if present.

        The boundary is extracted from the Content-Type header's `boundary'
        parameter, and it is unquoted.
        ''Set the boundary parameter in Content-Type to 'boundary'.

        This is subtly different than deleting the Content-Type header and
        adding a new one with a new boundary parameter via add_header().  The
        main difference is that using the set_boundary() method preserves the
        order of the Content-Type header in the original message.

        HeaderParseError is raised if the message has no Content-Type header.
        ''No Content-Type header found''Return the charset parameter of the Content-Type header.

        The returned string is always coerced to lower case.  If there is no
        Content-Type header, or if that header has no charset parameter,
        failobj is returned.
        ''Return a list containing the charset(s) used in this message.

        The returned list of items describes the Content-Type headers'
        charset parameter for this message and all the subparts in its
        payload.

        Each item will either be a string (the value of the charset parameter
        in the Content-Type header of that part) or the value of the
        'failobj' parameter (defaults to None), if the part does not have a
        main MIME type of "text", or the charset is not defined.

        The list will contain one string for each part of the message, plus
        one for the container message (i.e. self), so that a non-multipart
        message will still return a list of length 1.
        ''Return the message's content-disposition if it exists, or None.

        The return values can be either 'inline', 'attachment' or None
        according to the rfc2183.
        ''Return the entire formatted message as a string.

        Optional 'unixfrom', when true, means include the Unix From_ envelope
        header.  maxheaderlen is retained for backward compatibility with the
        base Message class, but defaults to None, meaning that the policy value
        for max_line_length controls the header maximum length.  'policy' is
        passed to the Generator instance used to serialize the message; if it
        is not specified the policy associated with the message instance is
        used.
        ''attachment''related''content-id''plain''Return best candidate mime part for display as 'body' of message.

        Do a depth first search, starting with self, looking for the first part
        matching each of the items in preferencelist, and return the part
        corresponding to the first item that has a match, or None if no items
        have a match.  If 'related' is not included in preferencelist, consider
        the root part of any multipart/related encountered as a candidate
        match.  Ignore parts with 'Content-Disposition: attachment'.
        ''alternative''Return an iterator over the non-main parts of a multipart.

        Skip the first of each occurrence of text/plain, text/html,
        multipart/related, or multipart/alternative in the multipart (unless
        they have a 'Content-Disposition: attachment' header) and include all
        remaining subparts in the returned iterator.  When applied to a
        multipart/related, return all parts except the root part.  Return an
        empty iterator when applied to a multipart/alternative or a
        non-multipart.
        ''Return an iterator over all immediate subparts of a multipart.

        Return an empty iterator for a non-multipart.

This module defines two useful functions:

guess_type(url, strict=True) -- guess the MIME type and encoding of a URL.

guess_extension(type, strict=True) -- guess the extension for a given MIME type.

It also contains the following, for tuning the behavior:

Data:

knownfiles -- list of files to parse
inited -- flag set when init() has been called
suffix_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes
encodings_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to encodings
types_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to types

Functions:

init([files]) -- parse a list of files, default knownfiles (on Windows, the
  default values are taken from the registry)
read_mime_types(file) -- parse one file, return a dictionary or None

Operator Interface

This module exports a set of functions corresponding to the intrinsic
operators of Python.  For example, operator.add(x, y) is equivalent
to the expression x+y.  The function names are those used for special
methods; variants without leading and trailing '__' are also provided
for convenience.

This is the pure Python implementation of the module.
''Same as a < b.''Same as a <= b.''Same as a == b.''Same as a != b.''Same as a >= b.''Same as a > b.''Same as not a.''Return True if a is true, False otherwise.''Same as a is b.''Same as a is not b.''Same as abs(a).''Same as a + b.''Same as a & b.''Same as a // b.''Same as a.__index__().''Same as ~a.''Same as a << b.''Same as a % b.''Same as a * b.''Same as a @ b.''Same as -a.''Same as a | b.''Same as +a.''Same as a ** b.''Same as a >> b.''Same as a - b.''Same as a / b.''Same as a ^ b.''Same as a + b, for a and b sequences.'''%s' object can't be concatenated''Same as b in a (note reversed operands).''Return the number of items in a which are, or which equal, b.''Same as del a[b].''Same as a[b].''Return the first index of b in a.''sequence.index(x): x not in sequence''Same as a[b] = c.''
    Return an estimate of the number of items in obj.
    This is useful for presizing containers when building from an iterable.

    If the object supports len(), the result will be exact. Otherwise, it may
    over- or under-estimate by an arbitrary amount. The result will be an
    integer >= 0.
    '''%s' object cannot be interpreted as an integer''__length_hint__ must be integer, not %s''__length_hint__() should return >= 0''Same as obj(*args, **kwargs).''
    Return a callable object that fetches the given attribute(s) from its operand.
    After f = attrgetter('name'), the call f(r) returns r.name.
    After g = attrgetter('name', 'date'), the call g(r) returns (r.name, r.date).
    After h = attrgetter('name.first', 'name.last'), the call h(r) returns
    (r.name.first, r.name.last).
    ''_attrs''attribute name must be a string''
    Return a callable object that fetches the given item(s) from its operand.
    After f = itemgetter(2), the call f(r) returns r[2].
    After g = itemgetter(2, 5, 3), the call g(r) returns (r[2], r[5], r[3])
    ''_items''
    Return a callable object that calls the given method on its operand.
    After f = methodcaller('name'), the call f(r) returns r.name().
    After g = methodcaller('name', 'date', foo=1), the call g(r) returns
    r.name('date', foo=1).
    ''_kwargs''method name must be a string''Same as a += b.''Same as a &= b.''Same as a += b, for a and b sequences.''Same as a //= b.''Same as a <<= b.''Same as a %= b.''Same as a *= b.''Same as a @= b.''Same as a |= b.''Same as a **= b.''Same as a >>= b.''Same as a -= b.''Same as a /= b.''Same as a ^= b.''OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.

This exports:
  - all functions from posix or nt, e.g. unlink, stat, etc.
  - os.path is either posixpath or ntpath
  - os.name is either 'posix' or 'nt'
  - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory (always '.')
  - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory (always '..')
  - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or '\\')
  - os.extsep is the extension separator (always '.')
  - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')
  - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc
  - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')
  - os.defpath is the default search path for executables
  - os.devnull is the file path of the null device ('/dev/null', etc.)

Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being
portable between different platforms.  Of course, they must then
only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink
and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path
(e.g., split and join).

    Super-mkdir; create a leaf directory and all intermediate ones.  Works like
    mkdir, except that any intermediate path segment (not just the rightmost)
    will be created if it does not exist. If the target directory already
    exists, raise an OSError if exist_ok is False. Otherwise no exception is
    raised.  This is recursive.

    ''removedirs''removedirs(name)

    Super-rmdir; remove a leaf directory and all empty intermediate
    ones.  Works like rmdir except that, if the leaf directory is
    successfully removed, directories corresponding to rightmost path
    segments will be pruned away until either the whole path is
    consumed or an error occurs.  Errors during this latter phase are
    ignored -- they generally mean that a directory was not empty.

    ''renames''renames(old, new)

    Super-rename; create directories as necessary and delete any left
    empty.  Works like rename, except creation of any intermediate
    directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted
    first.  After the rename, directories corresponding to rightmost
    path segments of the old name will be pruned until either the
    whole path is consumed or a nonempty directory is found.

    Note: this function can fail with the new directory structure made
    if you lack permissions needed to unlink the leaf directory or
    file.

    ''Directory tree generator.

    For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top
    itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple

        dirpath, dirnames, filenames

    dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of
    the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (including symlinks to directories,
    and excluding '.' and '..').
    filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.
    Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.
    To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in
    dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).

    If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
    directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
    (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple
    for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
    subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).

    When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place
    (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the
    subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the
    search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying dirnames when
    topdown is false has no effect on the behavior of os.walk(), since the
    directories in dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames
    itself is generated. No matter the value of topdown, the list of
    subdirectories is retrieved before the tuples for the directory and its
    subdirectories are generated.

    By default errors from the os.scandir() call are ignored.  If
    optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it
    will be called with one argument, an OSError instance.  It can
    report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception
    to abort the walk.  Note that the filename is available as the
    filename attribute of the exception object.

    By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on
    systems that support them.  In order to get this functionality, set the
    optional argument 'followlinks' to true.

    Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the
    current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never
    changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't
    either.

    Example:

    import os
    from os.path import join, getsize
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('python/Lib/email'):
        print(root, "consumes ")
        print(sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files), end=" ")
        print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")
        if 'CVS' in dirs:
            dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories

    ''os.walk''fwalk''Directory tree generator.

        This behaves exactly like walk(), except that it yields a 4-tuple

            dirpath, dirnames, filenames, dirfd

        `dirpath`, `dirnames` and `filenames` are identical to walk() output,
        and `dirfd` is a file descriptor referring to the directory `dirpath`.

        The advantage of fwalk() over walk() is that it's safe against symlink
        races (when follow_symlinks is False).

        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
          and top should be relative; top will then be relative to that directory.
          (dir_fd is always supported for fwalk.)

        Caution:
        Since fwalk() yields file descriptors, those are only valid until the
        next iteration step, so you should dup() them if you want to keep them
        for a longer period.

        Example:

        import os
        for root, dirs, files, rootfd in os.fwalk('python/Lib/email'):
            print(root, "consumes", end="")
            print(sum(os.stat(name, dir_fd=rootfd).st_size for name in files),
                  end="")
            print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")
            if 'CVS' in dirs:
                dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories

urlparse module is based upon the following RFC specifications.

RFC 3986 (STD66): "Uniform Resource Identifiers" by T. Berners-Lee, R. Fielding
and L.  Masinter, January 2005.

RFC 2732 : "Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's by R.Hinden, B.Carpenter

RFC 2396:  "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)": Generic Syntax by T.

RFC 2368: "The mailto URL scheme", by P.Hoffman , L Masinter, J. Zawinski, July 1998.

RFC 1808: "Relative Uniform Resource Locators", by R. Fielding, UC Irvine, June
1995.

RFC 1738: "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" by T. Berners-Lee, L. Masinter, M.
McCahill, December 1994

RFC 3986 is considered the current standard and any future changes to
urlparse module should conform with it.  The urlparse module is
currently not entirely compliant with this RFC due to defacto
scenarios for parsing, and for backward compatibility purposes, some
parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained. The testcases in
test_urlparse.py provides a good indicator of parsing behavior.

The WHATWG URL Parser spec should also be considered.  We are not compliant with
it either due to existing user code API behavior expectations (Hyrum's Law).
It serves as a useful guide when making changes.

    ''safe: bytes object.''<Quoter ''%{:02X}''quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'

    Each part of a URL, e.g. the path info, the query, etc., has a
    different set of reserved characters that must be quoted. The
    quote function offers a cautious (not minimal) way to quote a
    string for most of these parts.

    RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax lists
    the following (un)reserved characters.

    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    reserved      = gen-delims / sub-delims
    gen-delims    = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
    sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

    Each of the reserved characters is reserved in some component of a URL,
    but not necessarily in all of them.

    The quote function %-escapes all characters that are neither in the
    unreserved chars ("always safe") nor the additional chars set via the
    safe arg.

    The default for the safe arg is '/'. The character is reserved, but in
    typical usage the quote function is being called on a path where the
    existing slash characters are to be preserved.

    Python 3.7 updates from using RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 to quote URL strings.
    Now, "~" is included in the set of unreserved characters.

    string and safe may be either str or bytes objects. encoding and errors
    must not be specified if string is a bytes object.

    The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to deal with
    non-ASCII characters, as accepted by the str.encode method.
    By default, encoding='utf-8' (characters are encoded with UTF-8), and
    errors='strict' (unsupported characters raise a UnicodeEncodeError).
    ''quote() doesn't support 'encoding' for bytes''quote() doesn't support 'errors' for bytes''Like quote(), but also replace ' ' with '+', as required for quoting
    HTML form values. Plus signs in the original string are escaped unless
    they are included in safe. It also does not have safe default to '/'.
    ''Like quote(), but accepts a bytes object rather than a str, and does
    not perform string-to-bytes encoding.  It always returns an ASCII string.
    quote_from_bytes(b'abc def?') -> 'abc%20def%3f'
    ''quote_from_bytes() expected bytes''Encode a dict or sequence of two-element tuples into a URL query string.

    If any values in the query arg are sequences and doseq is true, each
    sequence element is converted to a separate parameter.

    If the query arg is a sequence of two-element tuples, the order of the
    parameters in the output will match the order of parameters in the
    input.

    The components of a query arg may each be either a string or a bytes type.

    The safe, encoding, and errors parameters are passed down to the function
    specified by quote_via (encoding and errors only if a component is a str).

The Python Debugger Pdb
=======================

To use the debugger in its simplest form:

        >>> import pdb
        >>> pdb.run('<a statement>')

The debugger's prompt is '(Pdb) '.  This will stop in the first
function call in <a statement>.

Alternatively, if a statement terminated with an unhandled exception,
you can use pdb's post-mortem facility to inspect the contents of the
traceback:

        >>> <a statement>
        <exception traceback>
        >>> import pdb
        >>> pdb.pm()

The commands recognized by the debugger are listed in the next
section.  Most can be abbreviated as indicated; e.g., h(elp) means
that 'help' can be typed as 'h' or 'help' (but not as 'he' or 'hel',
nor as 'H' or 'Help' or 'HELP').  Optional arguments are enclosed in
square brackets.  Alternatives in the command syntax are separated
by a vertical bar (|).

A blank line repeats the previous command literally, except for
'list', where it lists the next 11 lines.

Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python
statements and are executed in the context of the program being
debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation
point ('!').  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being
debugged; it is even possible to change variables or call functions.
When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is
printed but the debugger's state is not changed.

The debugger supports aliases, which can save typing.  And aliases can
have parameters (see the alias help entry) which allows one a certain
level of adaptability to the context under examination.

Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by the
pair ';;'.  No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the
input is split at the first ';;', even if it is in the middle of a
quoted string.

If a file ".pdbrc" exists in your home directory or in the current
directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the
debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for aliases.  If both
files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases
defined there can be overridden by the local file.  This behavior can be
disabled by passing the "readrc=False" argument to the Pdb constructor.

Aside from aliases, the debugger is not directly programmable; but it
is implemented as a class from which you can derive your own debugger
class, which you can make as fancy as you like.

        (com) ...
        (com) end
        (Pdb)

        Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number bpnumber.
        The commands themselves are entered on the following lines.
        Type a line containing just 'end' to terminate the commands.
        The commands are executed when the breakpoint is hit.

        To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type commands and
        follow it immediately with end; that is, give no commands.

        With no bpnumber argument, commands refers to the last
        breakpoint set.

        You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up
        again.  Simply use the continue command, or step, or any other
        command that resumes execution.

        Specifying any command resuming execution (currently continue,
        step, next, return, jump, quit and their abbreviations)
        terminates the command list (as if that command was
        immediately followed by end).  This is because any time you
        resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may
        encounter another breakpoint -- which could have its own
        command list, leading to ambiguities about which list to
        execute.

        If you use the 'silent' command in the command list, the usual
        message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This
        may be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific
        message and then continue.  If none of the other commands
        print anything, you will see no sign that the breakpoint was
        reached.

        end''cannot set commands: %s''(com) ''command definition aborted, old commands restored''b(reak) [ ([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition] ]

        Without argument, list all breaks.

        With a line number argument, set a break at this line in the
        current file.  With a function name, set a break at the first
        executable line of that function.  If a second argument is
        present, it is a string specifying an expression which must
        evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

        The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
        to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that
        hasn't been loaded yet).  The file is searched for on
        sys.path; the .py suffix may be omitted.

        Same arguments as break, but sets a temporary breakpoint: it
        is automatically deleted when first hit.
        ''Check whether specified line seems to be executable.

        Return `lineno` if it is, 0 if not (e.g. a docstring, comment, blank

        ''End of file''Blank or comment''enable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]

        Enables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of
        breakpoint numbers.
        ''Enabled %s''disable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]

        Disables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of
        breakpoint numbers.  Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot
        cause the program to stop execution, but unlike clearing a
        breakpoint, it remains in the list of breakpoints and can be
        (re-)enabled.
        ''Disabled %s''condition bpnumber [condition]

        Set a new condition for the breakpoint, an expression which
        must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.  If
        condition is absent, any existing condition is removed; i.e.,
        the breakpoint is made unconditional.
        ''Breakpoint %d is now unconditional.''New condition set for breakpoint %d.''ignore bpnumber [count]

        Set the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If
        count is omitted, the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint
        becomes active when the ignore count is zero.  When non-zero,
        the count is decremented each time the breakpoint is reached
        and the breakpoint is not disabled and any associated
        condition evaluates to true.
        ''%d crossings''1 crossing''Will ignore next %s of breakpoint %d.''Will stop next time breakpoint %d is reached.''cl(ear) [filename:lineno | bpnumber ...]

        With a space separated list of breakpoint numbers, clear
        those breakpoints.  Without argument, clear all breaks (but
        first ask confirmation).  With a filename:lineno argument,
        clear all breaks at that line in that file.
        ''Clear all breaks? ''yes''Deleted %s''Invalid line number (%s)''w(here)

        Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.
        An arrow indicates the "current frame", which determines the
        context of most commands.  'bt' is an alias for this command.
        ''u(p) [count]

        Move the current frame count (default one) levels up in the
        stack trace (to an older frame).
        ''Oldest frame''Invalid frame count (%s)''d(own) [count]

        Move the current frame count (default one) levels down in the
        stack trace (to a newer frame).
        ''Newest frame''unt(il) [lineno]

        Without argument, continue execution until the line with a
        number greater than the current one is reached.  With a line
        number, continue execution until a line with a number greater
        or equal to that is reached.  In both cases, also stop when
        the current frame returns.
        ''Error in argument: %r''"until" line number is smaller than current line number''do_step''s(tep)

        Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion
        (either in a function that is called or in the current
        function).
        ''do_next''n(ext)

        Continue execution until the next line in the current function
        is reached or it returns.
        ''run [args...]

        Restart the debugged python program. If a string is supplied
        it is split with "shlex", and the result is used as the new
        sys.argv.  History, breakpoints, actions and debugger options
        are preserved.  "restart" is an alias for "run".
        ''shlex''Cannot run %s: %s''do_return''r(eturn)

        Continue execution until the current function returns.
        ''do_continue''c(ont(inue))

        Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
        ''do_jump''j(ump) lineno

        Set the next line that will be executed.  Only available in
        the bottom-most frame.  This lets you jump back and execute
        code again, or jump forward to skip code that you don't want
        to run.

        It should be noted that not all jumps are allowed -- for
        instance it is not possible to jump into the middle of a
        for loop or out of a finally clause.
        ''You can only jump within the bottom frame''Jump failed: %s''The 'jump' command requires a line number''debug code

        Enter a recursive debugger that steps through the code
        argument (which is an arbitrary expression or statement to be
        executed in the current environment).
        ''ENTERING RECURSIVE DEBUGGER''LEAVING RECURSIVE DEBUGGER''do_quit''q(uit) | exit

        Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.
        ''EOF

        Handles the receipt of EOF as a command.
        ''a(rgs)

        Print the argument list of the current function.
        ''%s = %s''%s = *** undefined ***''retval

        Print the return value for the last return of a function.
        ''Not yet returned!''** raised %s **''*** repr('') failed: '' ***''p expression

        Print the value of the expression.
        ''pp expression

        Pretty-print the value of the expression.
        ''l(ist) [first[, last] | .]

        List source code for the current file.  Without arguments,
        list 11 lines around the current line or continue the previous
        listing.  With . as argument, list 11 lines around the current
        line.  With one argument, list 11 lines starting at that line.
        With two arguments, list the given range; if the second
        argument is less than the first, it is a count.

        The current line in the current frame is indicated by "->".
        If an exception is being debugged, the line where the
        exception was originally raised or propagated is indicated by
        ">>", if it differs from the current line.
        ''<frozen''[EOF]''ll | longlist

        List the whole source code for the current function or frame.
        ''source expression

        Try to get source code for the given object and display it.
        ''Print a range of lines.''whatis expression

        Print the type of the argument.
        ''Method %s''Function %s''Class %s.%s''display [expression]

        Display the value of the expression if it changed, each time execution
        stops in the current frame.

        Without expression, list all display expressions for the current frame.
        ''Currently displaying:''%s: %s''No expression is being displayed''Unable to display %s: %r''display %s: %s''undisplay [expression]

        Do not display the expression any more in the current frame.

        Without expression, clear all display expressions for the current frame.
        ''not displaying %s''interact

        Start an interactive interpreter whose global namespace
        contains all the (global and local) names found in the current scope.
        ''*interactive*''alias [name [command]]

        Create an alias called 'name' that executes 'command'.  The
        command must *not* be enclosed in quotes.  Replaceable
        parameters can be indicated by %1, %2, and so on, while %* is
        replaced by all the parameters.  If no command is given, the
        current alias for name is shown. If no name is given, all
        aliases are listed.

        Aliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be
        legally typed at the pdb prompt.  Note!  You *can* override
        internal pdb commands with aliases!  Those internal commands
        are then hidden until the alias is removed.  Aliasing is
        recursively applied to the first word of the command line; all
        other words in the line are left alone.

        As an example, here are two useful aliases (especially when
        placed in the .pdbrc file):

        # Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")
        alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print("%1.",k,"=",%1.__dict__[k])
        # Print instance variables in self
        alias ps pi self
        ''Unknown alias '''unalias name

        Delete the specified alias.
        ''> ''h(elp)

        Without argument, print the list of available commands.
        With a command name as argument, print help about that command.
        "help pdb" shows the full pdb documentation.
        "help exec" gives help on the ! command.
        ''No help for %r; please do not run Python with -OO if you need command help''No help for %r; __doc__ string missing''No help for %r''(!) statement

        Execute the (one-line) statement in the context of the current
        stack frame.  The exclamation point can be omitted unless the
        first word of the statement resembles a debugger command, e.g.:
        (Pdb) ! n=42
        (Pdb)

        To assign to a global variable you must always prefix the command with
        a 'global' command, e.g.:
        (Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']
        (Pdb)
        ''Helper function for break/clear parsing -- may be overridden.

        lookupmodule() translates (possibly incomplete) file or module name

    The debugger prompt appears before any code is executed; you can set
    breakpoints and type continue, or you can step through the statement
    using step or next.

    The optional *globals* and *locals* arguments specify the
    environment in which the code is executed; by default the
    dictionary of the module __main__ is used (see the explanation of
    the built-in exec() or eval() functions.).
    ''Evaluate the *expression* (given as a string or a code object)

    ''This takes a binary file for writing a pickle data stream.

        The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the
        given protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
        The default protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and
        is incompatible with previous versions.

        Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest
        protocol version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the
        more recent the version of Python needed to read the pickle
        produced.

        The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a
        single bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for
        binary writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom
        object that meets this interface.

        If *fix_imports* is True and *protocol* is less than 3, pickle
        will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names
        used in Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable
        with Python 2.

        If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
        serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

        If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
        of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
        (such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
        buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

        It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
        is None or smaller than 5.
        ''pickle protocol must be <= %d''buffer_callback needs protocol >= 5''_file_write''file must have a 'write' attribute''Clears the pickler's "memo".

        The memo is the data structure that remembers which objects the
        pickler has already seen, so that shared or recursive objects
        are pickled by reference and not by value.  This method is
        useful when re-using picklers.

        The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so
        no proto argument is needed.

        The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that
        takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires
        no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file*
        can be a binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO
        object, or any other custom object that meets this interface.

        The file-like object must have two methods, a read() method
        that takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that
        requires no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.
        Thus file-like object can be a binary file object opened for
        reading, a BytesIO object, or any other custom object that
        meets this interface.

        If *buffers* is not None, it should be an iterable of buffer-enabled
        objects that is consumed each time the pickle stream references
        an out-of-band buffer view.  Such buffers have been given in order
        to the *buffer_callback* of a Pickler object.

        If *buffers* is None (the default), then the buffers are taken
        from the pickle stream, assuming they are serialized there.
        It is an error for *buffers* to be None if the pickle stream
        was produced with a non-None *buffer_callback*.

        Other optional arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and
        *errors*, which are used to control compatibility support for
        pickle stream generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True,
        pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names
        used in Python 3.  The *encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how
        to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these
        default to 'ASCII' and 'strict', respectively. *encoding* can be
        'bytes' to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.

    on path, or, if path is None, all accessible modules.

    'path' should be either None or a list of paths to look for
    modules in.

    'prefix' is a string to output on the front of every module name
    on output.

    Note that this function must import all *packages* (NOT all
    modules!) on the given path, in order to access the __path__
    attribute to find submodules.

    'onerror' is a function which gets called with one argument (the
    name of the package which was being imported) if any exception
    occurs while trying to import a package.  If no onerror function is
    supplied, ImportErrors are caught and ignored, while all other
    exceptions are propagated, terminating the search.

    Examples:

    # list all modules python can access
    walk_packages()

    # list all submodules of ctypes
    walk_packages(ctypes.__path__, ctypes.__name__+'.')
    ''Yields ModuleInfo for all submodules on path,
    or, if path is None, all top-level modules on sys.path.

    'path' should be either None or a list of paths to look for

    ''path must be None or list of paths to look for modules in''zipimport''zipimporter''Retrieve a finder for the given path item

    The returned finder is cached in sys.path_importer_cache
    if it was newly created by a path hook.

    The cache (or part of it) can be cleared manually if a
    rescan of sys.path_hooks is necessary.
    ''Yield finders for the given module name

    If fullname contains a '.', the finders will be for the package
    containing fullname, otherwise they will be all registered top level
    finders (i.e. those on both sys.meta_path and sys.path_hooks).

    If the named module is in a package, that package is imported as a side
    effect of invoking this function.

    If no module name is specified, all top level finders are produced.
    ''Relative module name {!r} not supported''pkg''Get a "loader" object for module_or_name

    Returns None if the module cannot be found or imported.
    If the named module is not already imported, its containing package
    (if any) is imported, in order to establish the package __path__.
    ''pkgutil.get_loader''; use importlib.util.find_spec() instead''Find a "loader" object for fullname

    This is a backwards compatibility wrapper around
    importlib.util.find_spec that converts most failures to ImportError
    and only returns the loader rather than the full spec
    ''pkgutil.find_loader''Error while finding loader for {!r} ({}: {})''Extend a package's path.

    Intended use is to place the following code in a package's __init__.py:

        from pkgutil import extend_path
        __path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)

    For each directory on sys.path that has a subdirectory that
    matches the package name, add the subdirectory to the package's
    __path__.  This is useful if one wants to distribute different
    parts of a single logical package as multiple directories.

    It also looks for *.pkg files beginning where * matches the name
    argument.  This feature is similar to *.pth files (see site.py),
    except that it doesn't special-case lines starting with 'import'.
    A *.pkg file is trusted at face value: apart from checking for
    duplicates, all entries found in a *.pkg file are added to the
    path, regardless of whether they are exist the filesystem.  (This
    is a feature.)

    If the input path is not a list (as is the case for frozen
    packages) it is returned unchanged.  The input path is not
    modified; an extended copy is returned.  Items are only appended
    to the copy at the end.

    It is assumed that sys.path is a sequence.  Items of sys.path that
    are not (unicode or 8-bit) strings referring to existing
    directories are ignored.  Unicode items of sys.path that cause
    errors when used as filenames may cause this function to raise an
    exception (in line with os.path.isdir() behavior).
    ''.pkg''Can't open %s: %s
''Get a resource from a package.

    This is a wrapper round the PEP 302 loader get_data API. The package
    argument should be the name of a package, in standard module format
    (foo.bar). The resource argument should be in the form of a relative
    filename, using '/' as the path separator. The parent directory name '..'
    is not allowed, and nor is a rooted name (starting with a '/').

    The function returns a binary string, which is the contents of the
    specified resource.

    For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported,
    this is the rough equivalent of

        d = os.path.dirname(sys.modules[package].__file__)
        data = open(os.path.join(d, resource), 'rb').read()

    If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a PEP 302 loader
    which does not support get_data(), then None is returned.
    ''
    Resolve a name to an object.

    It is expected that `name` will be a string in one of the following
    formats, where W is shorthand for a valid Python identifier and dot stands
    for a literal period in these pseudo-regexes:

    W(.W)*
    W(.W)*:(W(.W)*)?

    The first form is intended for backward compatibility only. It assumes that
    some part of the dotted name is a package, and the rest is an object
    somewhere within that package, possibly nested inside other objects.
    Because the place where the package stops and the object hierarchy starts
    can't be inferred by inspection, repeated attempts to import must be done
    with this form.

    In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the
    provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a
    package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object
    hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If
    it ends with the colon, then a module object is returned.

    The function will return an object (which might be a module), or raise one
    of the following exceptions:

    ValueError - if `name` isn't in a recognised format
    ImportError - if an import failed when it shouldn't have
    AttributeError - if a failure occurred when traversing the object hierarchy
                     within the imported package to get to the desired object.
    ''(?!\d)(\w+)(\.(?!\d)(\w+))*''^(?P<pkg>'')(?P<cln>:(?P<obj>'')?)?$''invalid format: ''cln'' This module tries to retrieve as much platform-identifying data as
    possible. It makes this information available via function APIs.

    If called from the command line, it prints the platform
    information concatenated as single string to stdout. The output
    format is usable as part of a filename.

''1.0.8''dev''RC''rc''([0-9]+|[._+-])''._+-''lib'' Tries to determine the libc version that the file executable
        (which defaults to the Python interpreter) is linked against.

        Returns a tuple of strings (lib,version) which default to the
        given parameters in case the lookup fails.

        Note that the function has intimate knowledge of how different
        libc versions add symbols to the executable and thus is probably
        only usable for executables compiled using gcc.

        The file is read and scanned in chunks of chunksize bytes.

        version string using the format major.minor.build (or patchlevel).
    ''win16''dos'' Tries to figure out the OS version used and returns
        a tuple (system, release, version).

        It uses the "ver" shell command for this which is known
        to exists on Windows, DOS. XXX Others too ?

        In case this fails, the given parameters are used as
        defaults.

        Entries which cannot be determined are set to the parameter values
        which default to ''. All tuple entries are strings.
    '' Version interface for Jython.

        Returns a tuple (release, vendor, vminfo, osinfo) with vminfo being
        a tuple (vm_name, vm_release, vm_vendor) and osinfo being a
        tuple (os_name, os_version, os_arch).

        Values which cannot be determined are set to the defaults
        given as parameters (which all default to '').

    ''java''java.vendor''java.version''java.vm.name''java.vm.vendor''java.vm.version''java.os.arch''java.os.name''java.os.version'' Returns (system, release, version) aliased to common
        marketing names used for some systems.

        It also does some reordering of the information in some cases
        where it would otherwise cause confusion.

    ''SunOS''Solaris''Windows'' Helper to format the platform string in a filename
        compatible format e.g. "system-version-machine".
    '' Helper to determine the node name of this machine.
    '' In case filepath is a symlink, follow it until a
        real file is reached.
    '' Interface to the system's file command.

        The function uses the -b option of the file command to have it
        omit the filename in its output. Follow the symlinks. It returns
        default in case the command should fail.

    ''WindowsPE''MSDOS'' Queries the given executable (defaults to the Python interpreter
        binary) for various architecture information.

        Returns a tuple (bits, linkage) which contains information about
        the bit architecture and the linkage format used for the
        executable. Both values are returned as strings.

        Values that cannot be determined are returned as given by the
        parameter presets. If bits is given as '', the sizeof(pointer)
        (or sizeof(long) on Python version < 1.5.2) is used as
        indicator for the supported pointer size.

        The function relies on the system's "file" command to do the
        actual work. This is available on most if not all Unix
        platforms. On some non-Unix platforms where the "file" command
        does not exist and the executable is set to the Python interpreter
        binary defaults from _default_architecture are used.

        ''uname_result_base''system node release version machine''
    A uname_result that's largely compatible with a
    simple namedtuple except that 'processor' is
    resolved late and cached to avoid calling "uname"
    except when needed.
    ''processor'' Fairly portable uname interface. Returns a tuple
        of strings (system, node, release, version, machine, processor)
        identifying the underlying platform.

        Note that unlike the os.uname function this also returns
        possible processor information as an additional tuple entry.

        Entries which cannot be determined are set to ''.

    ''Microsoft Windows''Microsoft''6.0''16bit''Java''OpenVMS'' Returns the system/OS name, e.g. 'Linux', 'Windows' or 'Java'.

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

    '' Returns the computer's network name (which may not be fully
        qualified)

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

    '' Returns the system's release, e.g. '2.2.0' or 'NT'

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

    '' Returns the system's release version, e.g. '#3 on degas'

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

    '' Returns the machine type, e.g. 'i386'

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

    '' Returns the (true) processor name, e.g. 'amdk6'

        An empty string is returned if the value cannot be
        determined. Note that many platforms do not provide this
        information or simply return the same value as for machine(),
        e.g.  NetBSD does this.

    '' Returns a parsed version of Python's sys.version as tuple
        (name, version, branch, revision, buildno, builddate, compiler)
        referring to the Python implementation name, version, branch,
        revision, build number, build date/time as string and the compiler
        identification string.

        Note that unlike the Python sys.version, the returned value
        for the Python version will always include the patchlevel (it
        defaults to '.0').

        The function returns empty strings for tuple entries that
        cannot be determined.

        sys_version may be given to parse an alternative version
        string, e.g. if the version was read from a different Python
        interpreter.

          'PyPy' (Python implementation of Python).

    '' Returns the Python version as string 'major.minor.patchlevel'

        Note that unlike the Python sys.version, the returned value
        will always include the patchlevel (it defaults to 0).

    '' Returns the Python version as tuple (major, minor, patchlevel)
        of strings.

        Note that unlike the Python sys.version, the returned value

        The output is intended to be human readable rather than
        machine parseable. It may look different on different
        platforms and this is intended.

        If "aliased" is true, the function will use aliases for
        various platforms that report system names which differ from
        their common names, e.g. SunOS will be reported as
        Solaris. The system_alias() function is used to implement
        this.

        Setting terse to true causes the function to return only the
        absolute minimum information needed to identify the platform.

    ''Unable to read files ''--terse''nonaliased''--nonaliased''plistlib.py -- a tool to generate and parse MacOSX .plist files.

The property list (.plist) file format is a simple XML pickle supporting
basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and strings.
Usually the top level object is a dictionary.

To write out a plist file, use the dump(value, file)
function. 'value' is the top level object, 'file' is
a (writable) file object.

To parse a plist from a file, use the load(file) function,
with a (readable) file object as the only argument. It
returns the top level object (again, usually a dictionary).

To work with plist data in bytes objects, you can use loads()
and dumps().

Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists,
dictionaries (but only with string keys), Data, bytes, bytearray, or
datetime.datetime objects.

Generate Plist example:

    import datetime
    import plistlib

    pl = dict(
        aString = "Doodah",
        aList = ["A", "B", 12, 32.1, [1, 2, 3]],
        aFloat = 0.1,
        anInt = 728,
        aDict = dict(
            anotherString = "<hello & hi there!>",
            aThirdString = "M\xe4ssig, Ma\xdf",
            aTrueValue = True,
            aFalseValue = False,
        ),
        someData = b"<binary gunk>",
        someMoreData = b"<lots of binary gunk>" * 10,
        aDate = datetime.datetime.now()
    )
    print(plistlib.dumps(pl).decode())

Parse Plist example:

    import plistlib

Executor.submit() called:
- creates a uniquely numbered _WorkItem and adds it to the "Work Items" dict
- adds the id of the _WorkItem to the "Work Ids" queue

Local worker thread:
- reads work ids from the "Work Ids" queue and looks up the corresponding
  WorkItem from the "Work Items" dict: if the work item has been cancelled then
  it is simply removed from the dict, otherwise it is repackaged as a
  _CallItem and put in the "Call Q". New _CallItems are put in the "Call Q"
  until "Call Q" is full. NOTE: the size of the "Call Q" is kept small because
  calls placed in the "Call Q" can no longer be cancelled with Future.cancel().
- reads _ResultItems from "Result Q", updates the future stored in the
  "Work Items" dict and deletes the dict entry

Process #1..n:
- reads _CallItems from "Call Q", executes the calls, and puts the resulting
  _ResultItems in "Result Q"

        ''/mp''semprefix''SIG''Abstract Protocol base classes.''DatagramProtocol''SubprocessProtocol''Common base class for protocol interfaces.

    Usually user implements protocols that derived from BaseProtocol
    like Protocol or ProcessProtocol.

    The only case when BaseProtocol should be implemented directly is
    write-only transport like write pipe
    ''Called when a connection is made.

        The argument is the transport representing the pipe connection.
        To receive data, wait for data_received() calls.
        When the connection is closed, connection_lost() is called.
        ''Called when the connection is lost or closed.

        The argument is an exception object or None (the latter
        meaning a regular EOF is received or the connection was
        aborted or closed).
        ''Called when the transport's buffer goes over the high-water mark.

        Pause and resume calls are paired -- pause_writing() is called
        once when the buffer goes strictly over the high-water mark
        (even if subsequent writes increases the buffer size even
        more), and eventually resume_writing() is called once when the
        buffer size reaches the low-water mark.

        Note that if the buffer size equals the high-water mark,
        pause_writing() is not called -- it must go strictly over.
        Conversely, resume_writing() is called when the buffer size is
        equal or lower than the low-water mark.  These end conditions
        are important to ensure that things go as expected when either
        mark is zero.

        NOTE: This is the only Protocol callback that is not called
        through EventLoop.call_soon() -- if it were, it would have no
        effect when it's most needed (when the app keeps writing
        without yielding until pause_writing() is called).
        ''Called when the transport's buffer drains below the low-water mark.

        See pause_writing() for details.
        ''Interface for stream protocol.

    The user should implement this interface.  They can inherit from
    this class but don't need to.  The implementations here do
    nothing (they don't raise exceptions).

    When the user wants to requests a transport, they pass a protocol
    factory to a utility function (e.g., EventLoop.create_connection()).

    When the connection is made successfully, connection_made() is
    called with a suitable transport object.  Then data_received()
    will be called 0 or more times with data (bytes) received from the
    transport; finally, connection_lost() will be called exactly once
    with either an exception object or None as an argument.

    State machine of calls:

      start -> CM [-> DR*] [-> ER?] -> CL -> end

    * CM: connection_made()
    * DR: data_received()
    * ER: eof_received()
    * CL: connection_lost()
    ''Called when some data is received.

        The argument is a bytes object.
        ''Called when the other end calls write_eof() or equivalent.

        If this returns a false value (including None), the transport
        will close itself.  If it returns a true value, closing the
        transport is up to the protocol.
        ''Interface for stream protocol with manual buffer control.

    Event methods, such as `create_server` and `create_connection`,
    accept factories that return protocols that implement this interface.

    The idea of BufferedProtocol is that it allows to manually allocate
    and control the receive buffer.  Event loops can then use the buffer
    provided by the protocol to avoid unnecessary data copies.  This
    can result in noticeable performance improvement for protocols that
    receive big amounts of data.  Sophisticated protocols can allocate
    the buffer only once at creation time.

    State machine of calls:

      start -> CM [-> GB [-> BU?]]* [-> ER?] -> CL -> end

    * CM: connection_made()
    * GB: get_buffer()
    * BU: buffer_updated()
    * ER: eof_received()
    * CL: connection_lost()
    ''get_buffer''Called to allocate a new receive buffer.

        *sizehint* is a recommended minimal size for the returned
        buffer.  When set to -1, the buffer size can be arbitrary.

        Must return an object that implements the
        :ref:`buffer protocol <bufferobjects>`.
        It is an error to return a zero-sized buffer.
        ''Called when the buffer was updated with the received data.

        *nbytes* is the total number of bytes that were written to
        the buffer.
        ''Interface for datagram protocol.''Called when some datagram is received.''Called when a send or receive operation raises an OSError.

        (Other than BlockingIOError or InterruptedError.)

At the Python interactive prompt, calling help(thing) on a Python object
documents the object, and calling help() starts up an interactive
help session.

Or, at the shell command line outside of Python:

Run "pydoc <name>" to show documentation on something.  <name> may be
the name of a function, module, package, or a dotted reference to a
class or function within a module or module in a package.  If the
argument contains a path segment delimiter (e.g. slash on Unix,
backslash on Windows) it is treated as the path to a Python source file.

Run "pydoc -k <keyword>" to search for a keyword in the synopsis lines
of all available modules.

Run "pydoc -n <hostname>" to start an HTTP server with the given
hostname (default: localhost) on the local machine.

Run "pydoc -p <port>" to start an HTTP server on the given port on the
local machine.  Port number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.

Run "pydoc -b" to start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and
open a web browser to interactively browse documentation.  Combine with
the -n and -p options to control the hostname and port used.

Run "pydoc -w <name>" to write out the HTML documentation for a module
to a file named "<name>.html".

    Start an HTML/text server thread, so HTML or text documents can be
    browsed dynamically and interactively with a web browser.  Example use:

        >>> import time
        >>> import pydoc

        Define a URL handler.  To determine what the client is asking
        for, check the URL and content_type.

        Then get or generate some text or HTML code and return it.

        >>> def my_url_handler(url, content_type):
        ...     text = 'the URL sent was: (%s, %s)' % (url, content_type)
        ...     return text

        Start server thread on port 0.
        If you use port 0, the server will pick a random port number.
        You can then use serverthread.port to get the port number.

        >>> port = 0
        >>> serverthread = pydoc._start_server(my_url_handler, port)

        Check that the server is really started.  If it is, open browser
        and get first page.  Use serverthread.url as the starting page.

        >>> if serverthread.serving:
        ...    import webbrowser

        The next two lines are commented out so a browser doesn't open if
        doctest is run on this module.

        #...    webbrowser.open(serverthread.url)
        #True

        Let the server do its thing. We just need to monitor its status.
        Use time.sleep so the loop doesn't hog the CPU.

        >>> starttime = time.monotonic()
        >>> timeout = 1                    #seconds

        This is a short timeout for testing purposes.

        >>> while serverthread.serving:
        ...     time.sleep(.01)
        ...     if serverthread.serving and time.monotonic() - starttime > timeout:
        ...          serverthread.stop()
        ...          break

        Print any errors that may have occurred.

''Quoted-printable content transfer encoding per RFCs 2045-2047.

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode US ASCII-like 8-bit data called `quoted-printable'.  It is used to
safely encode text that is in a character set similar to the 7-bit US ASCII
character set, but that includes some 8-bit characters that are normally not
allowed in email bodies or headers.

Quoted-printable is very space-inefficient for encoding binary files; use the
email.base64mime module for that instead.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with quoted-printable encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:/From:/Cc: etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character
conversion necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only
does dumb encoding and decoding.  To deal with the various line
wrapping issues, use the email.header module.

    ''Turn a string in the form =AB to the ASCII character with value 0xab''Encode a single header line with quoted-printable (like) encoding.

    Defined in RFC 2045, this `Q' encoding is similar to quoted-printable, but

    defaults to iso-8859-1.
    ''=?%s?q?%s?=''Encode with quoted-printable, wrapping at maxlinelen characters.

    Each line of encoded text will end with eol, which defaults to "\n".  Set
    this to "\r\n" if you will be using the result of this function directly
    in an email.

    Each line will be wrapped at, at most, maxlinelen characters before the
    eol string (maxlinelen defaults to 76 characters, the maximum value
    permitted by RFC 2045).  Long lines will have the 'soft line break'
    quoted-printable character "=" appended to them, so the decoded text will
    be identical to the original text.

    The minimum maxlinelen is 4 to have room for a quoted character ("=XX")
    followed by a soft line break.  Smaller values will generate a
    ValueError.

    ''maxlinelen must be at least 4''Decode a quoted-printable string.

    Lines are separated with eol, which defaults to \n.

General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:

* The period is 2**19937-1.
* It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
* The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
  and is, therefore, threadsafe.

    Used to instantiate instances of Random to get generators that don't
    share state.

    Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic
    generator of your own devising: in that case, override the following
    methods:  random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate().
    Optionally, implement a getrandbits() method so that randrange()
    can cover arbitrarily large ranges.

    ''Initialize an instance.

        Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
        ''Initialize internal state from a seed.

        The only supported seed types are None, int, float,
        str, bytes, and bytearray.

        None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
        system specific randomness source if available.

        If *a* is an int, all bits are used.

        For version 2 (the default), all of the bits are used if *a* is a str,
        bytes, or bytearray.  For version 1 (provided for reproducing random
        sequences from older versions of Python), the algorithm for str and
        bytes generates a narrower range of seeds.

        ''The only supported seed types are: None,
int, float, str, bytes, and bytearray.''Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.''Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().''state with version %s passed to Random.setstate() of version %s''Control how subclasses generate random integers.

        The algorithm a subclass can use depends on the random() and/or
        getrandbits() implementation available to it and determines
        whether it can generate random integers from arbitrarily large
        ranges.
        ''_randbelow''Return a random int in the range [0,n).  Defined for n > 0.''Return a random int in the range [0,n).  Defined for n > 0.

        The implementation does not use getrandbits, but only random.
        ''Underlying random() generator does not supply 
enough bits to choose from a population range this large.
To remove the range limitation, add a getrandbits() method.''Generate n random bytes.''Choose a random item from range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]).

        Roughly equivalent to ``choice(range(start, stop, step))`` but
        supports arbitrarily large ranges and is optimized for common cases.

        ''Missing a non-None stop argument''empty range for randrange()''empty range in randrange(''zero step for randrange()''Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
        ''Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.''Cannot choose from an empty sequence''Shuffle list x in place, and return None.''Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.

        Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
        leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
        in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
        samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
        into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

        Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
        population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
        selection in the sample.

        Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
        counts parameter.  For example:

            sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)

        is equivalent to:

            sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5)

        To choose a sample from a range of integers, use range() for the
        population argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient
        for sampling from a large population:

            sample(range(10000000), 60)

        ''Population must be a sequence.  For dicts or sets, use sorted(d).''The number of counts does not match the population''Counts must be integers''Total of counts must be greater than zero''Sample larger than population or is negative''Return a k sized list of population elements chosen with replacement.

        If the relative weights or cumulative weights are not specified,
        the selections are made with equal probability.

    The context manager always creates a new event loop,
    allows to run async functions inside it,
    and properly finalizes the loop at the context manager exit.

    If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.
    If loop_factory is passed, it is used for new event loop creation.

    asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)

    is a shortcut for

    with asyncio.Runner(debug=True) as runner:
        runner.run(main())

    The run() method can be called multiple times within the runner's context.

    This can be useful for interactive console (e.g. IPython),
    unittest runners, console tools, -- everywhere when async code
    is called from existing sync framework and where the preferred single
    asyncio.run() call doesn't work.

    This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is

    If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

    This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end.
    It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should
    ideally only be called once.

Note: BaseHTTPRequestHandler doesn't implement any HTTP request; see
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler for simple implementations of GET, HEAD and POST,
and CGIHTTPRequestHandler for CGI scripts.

It does, however, optionally implement HTTP/1.1 persistent connections,
as of version 0.3.

Notes on CGIHTTPRequestHandler
------------------------------

This class implements GET and POST requests to cgi-bin scripts.

If the os.fork() function is not present (e.g. on Windows),
subprocess.Popen() is used as a fallback, with slightly altered semantics.

In all cases, the implementation is intentionally naive -- all
requests are executed synchronously.

SECURITY WARNING: DON'T USE THIS CODE UNLESS YOU ARE INSIDE A FIREWALL
-- it may execute arbitrary Python code or external programs.

Note that status code 200 is sent prior to execution of a CGI script, so
scripts cannot send other status codes such as 302 (redirect).

XXX To do:

- log requests even later (to capture byte count)
- log user-agent header and other interesting goodies
- send error log to separate file

    The following explanation of HTTP serves to guide you through the
    code as well as to expose any misunderstandings I may have about
    HTTP (so you don't need to read the code to figure out I'm wrong
    :-).

    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an extensible protocol on
    top of a reliable stream transport (e.g. TCP/IP).  The protocol
    recognizes three parts to a request:

    1. One line identifying the request type and path
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. An optional data part

    The headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path> <version>

    where <command> is a (case-sensitive) keyword such as GET or POST,
    <path> is a string containing path information for the request,
    and <version> should be the string "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".
    <path> is encoded using the URL encoding scheme (using %xx to signify
    the ASCII character with hex code xx).

    The specification specifies that lines are separated by CRLF but
    for compatibility with the widest range of clients recommends
    servers also handle LF.  Similarly, whitespace in the request line
    is treated sensibly (allowing multiple spaces between components
    and allowing trailing whitespace).

    Similarly, for output, lines ought to be separated by CRLF pairs
    but most clients grok LF characters just fine.

    If the first line of the request has the form

    <command> <path>

    (i.e. <version> is left out) then this is assumed to be an HTTP
    0.9 request; this form has no optional headers and data part and
    the reply consists of just the data.

    The reply form of the HTTP 1.x protocol again has three parts:

    1. One line giving the response code
    2. An optional set of RFC-822-style headers
    3. The data

    Again, the headers and data are separated by a blank line.

    The response code line has the form

    <version> <responsecode> <responsestring>

    where <version> is the protocol version ("HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1"),
    <responsecode> is a 3-digit response code indicating success or
    failure of the request, and <responsestring> is an optional
    human-readable string explaining what the response code means.

    This server parses the request and the headers, and then calls a
    function specific to the request type (<command>).  Specifically,
    a request SPAM will be handled by a method do_SPAM().  If no
    such method exists the server sends an error response to the
    client.  If it exists, it is called with no arguments:

    do_SPAM()

    Note that the request name is case sensitive (i.e. SPAM and spam
    are different requests).

    The various request details are stored in instance variables:

    - client_address is the client IP address in the form (host,
    port);

    - command, path and version are the broken-down request line;

    - headers is an instance of email.message.Message (or a derived
    class) containing the header information;

    - rfile is a file object open for reading positioned at the
    start of the optional input data part;

    - wfile is a file object open for writing.

    IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOL FOR WRITING!

    The first thing to be written must be the response line.  Then
    follow 0 or more header lines, then a blank line, and then the
    actual data (if any).  The meaning of the header lines depends on
    the command executed by the server; in most cases, when data is
    returned, there should be at least one header line of the form

    Content-type: <type>/<subtype>

    where <type> and <subtype> should be registered MIME types,
    e.g. "text/html" or "text/plain".

    ''Python/''BaseHTTP/''Parse a request (internal).

        The request should be stored in self.raw_requestline; the results
        are in self.command, self.path, self.request_version and
        self.headers.

        Return True for success, False for failure; on failure, any relevant
        error response has already been sent back.

        ''non digit in http version''unreasonable length http version''Bad request version (%r)''Invalid HTTP version (%s)''Bad request syntax (%r)''Bad HTTP/0.9 request type (%r)''Line too long''Too many headers''Expect''100-continue''Decide what to do with an "Expect: 100-continue" header.

        If the client is expecting a 100 Continue response, we must
        respond with either a 100 Continue or a final response before
        waiting for the request body. The default is to always respond
        with a 100 Continue. You can behave differently (for example,
        reject unauthorized requests) by overriding this method.

        This method should either return True (possibly after sending
        a 100 Continue response) or send an error response and return
        False.

        ''Handle a single HTTP request.

        You normally don't need to override this method; see the class
        __doc__ string for information on how to handle specific HTTP
        commands such as GET and POST.

        ''Unsupported method (%r)''Request timed out: %r''Handle multiple requests if necessary.''explain''Send and log an error reply.

        Arguments are
        * code:    an HTTP error code
                   3 digits
        * message: a simple optional 1 line reason phrase.
                   *( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / %x80-FF )
                   defaults to short entry matching the response code
        * explain: a detailed message defaults to the long entry
                   matching the response code.

        This sends an error response (so it must be called before any
        output has been generated), logs the error, and finally sends
        a piece of HTML explaining the error to the user.

        ''code %d, message %s''Add the response header to the headers buffer and log the
        response code.

        Also send two standard headers with the server software
        version and the current date.

        ''Date''Send the response header only.''_headers_buffer''%s %d %s
''Send a MIME header to the headers buffer.''%s: %s
''Send the blank line ending the MIME headers.''Log an accepted request.

        This is called by send_response().

        ''"%s" %s %s''Log an error.

        This is called when a request cannot be fulfilled.  By
        default it passes the message on to log_message().

        Arguments are the same as for log_message().

        XXX This should go to the separate error log.

        ''\x''Log an arbitrary message.

        This is used by all other logging functions.  Override
        it if you have specific logging wishes.

        The first argument, FORMAT, is a format string for the
        message to be logged.  If the format string contains
        any % escapes requiring parameters, they should be
        specified as subsequent arguments (it's just like
        printf!).

        The client ip and current date/time are prefixed to
        every message.

        Unicode control characters are replaced with escaped hex
        before writing the output to stderr.

    This serves files from the current directory and any of its
    subdirectories.  The MIME type for files is determined by
    calling the .guess_type() method.

    request omits the actual contents of the file.

        Return value is either a file object (which has to be copied
        to the outputfile by the caller unless the command was HEAD,
        and must be closed by the caller under all circumstances), or
        None, in which case the caller has nothing further to do.

        Return value is either a file object, or None (indicating an

        probably be diagnosed.)

        ''Copy all data between two file objects.

        The SOURCE argument is a file object open for reading
        (or anything with a read() method) and the DESTINATION
        argument is a file object open for writing (or
        anything with a write() method).

        The only reason for overriding this would be to change
        the block size or perhaps to replace newlines by CRLF
        -- note however that this the default server uses this
        to copy binary data as well.

        ''Guess the type of a file.

        Return value is a string of the form type/subtype,

        The default implementation looks the file's extension
        up in the table self.extensions_map, using application/octet-stream
        as a default; however it would be permissible (if
        slow) to look inside the data to make a better guess.

        Returns False otherwise.

        If any exception is raised, the caller should assume that
        self.path was rejected as invalid and act accordingly.

        The default implementation tests whether the normalized url
        path begins with one of the strings in self.cgi_directories
        (and the next character is a '/' or the end of the string).

    unaffected. `src` and `dst` are path-like objects or path names given as
    strings.

    ''Copy data and metadata. Return the file's destination.

    ''Function that can be used as copytree() ignore parameter.

    Patterns is a sequence of glob-style patterns
    that are used to exclude files''Recursively copy a directory tree and return the destination directory.

    If exception(s) occur, an Error is raised with a list of reasons.

    If the optional symlinks flag is true, symbolic links in the
    source tree result in symbolic links in the destination tree; if
    it is false, the contents of the files pointed to by symbolic
    links are copied. If the file pointed to by the symlink doesn't
    exist, an exception will be added in the list of errors raised in
    an Error exception at the end of the copy process.

    You can set the optional ignore_dangling_symlinks flag to true if you
    want to silence this exception. Notice that this has no effect on
    platforms that don't support os.symlink.

    The optional ignore argument is a callable. If given, it
    is called with the `src` parameter, which is the directory
    being visited by copytree(), and `names` which is the list of
    `src` contents, as returned by os.listdir():

        callable(src, names) -> ignored_names

    Since copytree() is called recursively, the callable will be
    called once for each directory that is copied. It returns a
    list of names relative to the `src` directory that should
    not be copied.

    The optional copy_function argument is a callable that will be used
    to copy each file. It will be called with the source path and the
    destination path as arguments. By default, copy2() is used, but any
    function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.

    If dirs_exist_ok is false (the default) and `dst` already exists, a
    `FileExistsError` is raised. If `dirs_exist_ok` is true, the copying
    operation will continue if it encounters existing directories, and files
    within the `dst` tree will be overwritten by corresponding files from the
    `src` tree.
    ''shutil.copytree''Cannot call rmtree on a symbolic link''Recursively delete a directory tree.

    If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory;
    path will then be relative to that directory.
    dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
    If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.

    If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onexc or
    onerror is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func,
    path, exc_info) where func is platform and implementation dependent;
    path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and
    the value of exc_info describes the exception. For onexc it is the
    exception instance, and for onerror it is a tuple as returned by
    sys.exc_info().  If ignore_errors is false and both onexc and
    onerror are None, the exception is reraised.

    onerror is deprecated and only remains for backwards compatibility.
    If both onerror and onexc are set, onerror is ignored and onexc is used.
    ''shutil.rmtree''dir_fd unavailable on this platform''A basename() variant which first strips the trailing slash, if present.
    Thus we always get the last component of the path, even for directories.

    path: Union[PathLike, str]

    e.g.
    >>> os.path.basename('/bar/foo')
    'foo'
    >>> os.path.basename('/bar/foo/')

    >>> _basename('/bar/foo/')
    'foo'
    ''Recursively move a file or directory to another location. This is
    similar to the Unix "mv" command. Return the file or directory's

    If dst is an existing directory or a symlink to a directory, then src is
    moved inside that directory. The destination path in that directory must
    not already exist.

    If dst already exists but is not a directory, it may be overwritten
    depending on os.rename() semantics.

    If the destination is on our current filesystem, then rename() is used.
    Otherwise, src is copied to the destination and then removed. Symlinks are
    recreated under the new name if os.rename() fails because of cross
    filesystem renames.

    The optional `copy_function` argument is a callable that will be used
    to copy the source or it will be delegated to `copytree`.
    By default, copy2() is used, but any function that supports the same
    signature (like copy()) can be used.

    ''Generic socket server classes.

This module tries to capture the various aspects of defining a server:

For socket-based servers:

- address family:
        - AF_INET{,6}: IP (Internet Protocol) sockets (default)
        - AF_UNIX: Unix domain sockets
        - others, e.g. AF_DECNET are conceivable (see <socket.h>
- socket type:
        - SOCK_STREAM (reliable stream, e.g. TCP)
        - SOCK_DGRAM (datagrams, e.g. UDP)

For request-based servers (including socket-based):

- client address verification before further looking at the request
        (This is actually a hook for any processing that needs to look
         at the request before anything else, e.g. logging)
- how to handle multiple requests:
        - synchronous (one request is handled at a time)
        - forking (each request is handled by a new process)
        - threading (each request is handled by a new thread)

The classes in this module favor the server type that is simplest to
write: a synchronous TCP/IP server.  This is bad class design, but
saves some typing.  (There's also the issue that a deep class hierarchy
slows down method lookups.)

There are five classes in an inheritance diagram, four of which represent
synchronous servers of four types:

        +------------+
        | BaseServer |
        +------------+
              |
              v
        +-----------+        +------------------+
        | TCPServer |------->| UnixStreamServer |
        +-----------+        +------------------+
              |
              v
        +-----------+        +--------------------+
        | UDPServer |------->| UnixDatagramServer |
        +-----------+        +--------------------+

Note that UnixDatagramServer derives from UDPServer, not from
UnixStreamServer -- the only difference between an IP and a Unix
stream server is the address family, which is simply repeated in both
unix server classes.

Forking and threading versions of each type of server can be created
using the ForkingMixIn and ThreadingMixIn mix-in classes.  For
instance, a threading UDP server class is created as follows:

        class ThreadingUDPServer(ThreadingMixIn, UDPServer): pass

The Mix-in class must come first, since it overrides a method defined
in UDPServer! Setting the various member variables also changes
the behavior of the underlying server mechanism.

To implement a service, you must derive a class from
BaseRequestHandler and redefine its handle() method.  You can then run
various versions of the service by combining one of the server classes
with your request handler class.

The request handler class must be different for datagram or stream
services.  This can be hidden by using the request handler
subclasses StreamRequestHandler or DatagramRequestHandler.

Of course, you still have to use your head!

For instance, it makes no sense to use a forking server if the service
contains state in memory that can be modified by requests (since the
modifications in the child process would never reach the initial state
kept in the parent process and passed to each child).  In this case,
you can use a threading server, but you will probably have to use
locks to avoid two requests that come in nearly simultaneous to apply
conflicting changes to the server state.

On the other hand, if you are building e.g. an HTTP server, where all
data is stored externally (e.g. in the file system), a synchronous
class will essentially render the service "deaf" while one request is
being handled -- which may be for a very long time if a client is slow
to read all the data it has requested.  Here a threading or forking
server is appropriate.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request
synchronously, but to finish processing in a forked child depending on
the request data.  This can be implemented by using a synchronous
server and doing an explicit fork in the request handler class
handle() method.

Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an
environment that supports neither threads nor fork (or where these are
too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an
explicit table of partially finished requests and to use a selector to
decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new
incoming request).  This is particularly important for stream services
where each client can potentially be connected for a long time (if
threads or subprocesses cannot be used).

Future work:
- Standard classes for Sun RPC (which uses either UDP or TCP)
- Standard mix-in classes to implement various authentication
  and encryption schemes

        ''Start a new thread to process the request.''Base class for request handler classes.

    This class is instantiated for each request to be handled.  The
    constructor sets the instance variables request, client_address
    and server, and then calls the handle() method.  To implement a
    specific service, all you need to do is to derive a class which
    defines a handle() method.

    The handle() method can find the request as self.request, the
    client address as self.client_address, and the server (in case it
    needs access to per-server information) as self.server.  Since a
    separate instance is created for each request, the handle() method
    can define other arbitrary instance variables.

        This probably means that you are not using fork to start your

        in the main module:

        Due to technical  limitations, the callback can't be used to filter
        traffic or to abort a connection. Any exception raised in the
        callback is delayed until the handshake, read, or write operation
        has been performed.

    ''certfile must be specified''This class implements an interface on top of a low-level SSL object as
    implemented by OpenSSL. This object captures the state of an SSL connection
    but does not provide any network IO itself. IO needs to be performed
    through separate "BIO" objects which are OpenSSL's IO abstraction layer.

    This class does not have a public constructor. Instances are returned by
    ``SSLContext.wrap_bio``. This class is typically used by framework authors
    that want to implement asynchronous IO for SSL through memory buffers.

    When compared to ``SSLSocket``, this object lacks the following features:

     * Any form of network IO, including methods such as ``recv`` and ``send``.
     * The ``do_handshake_on_connect`` and ``suppress_ragged_eofs`` machinery.

        ''Support for running coroutines in parallel with staggered start times.''Optional''Any''Run coroutines with staggered start times and take the first to finish.

    This method takes an iterable of coroutine functions. The first one is
    started immediately. From then on, whenever the immediately preceding one
    fails (raises an exception), or when *delay* seconds has passed, the next
    coroutine is started. This continues until one of the coroutines complete
    successfully, in which case all others are cancelled, or until all
    coroutines fail.

    The coroutines provided should be well-behaved in the following way:

    * They should only ``return`` if completed successfully.

    * They should always raise an exception if they did not complete
      successfully. In particular, if they handle cancellation, they should
      probably reraise, like this::

        try:
            # do work
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # undo partially completed work
            raise

    Args:
        coro_fns: an iterable of coroutine functions, i.e. callables that
            return a coroutine object when called. Use ``functools.partial`` or
            lambdas to pass arguments.

        delay: amount of time, in seconds, between starting coroutines. If
            ``None``, the coroutines will run sequentially.

        loop: the event loop to use.

    Returns:
        tuple *(winner_result, winner_index, exceptions)* where

        - *winner_result*: the result of the winning coroutine, or ``None``
          if no coroutines won.

        - *winner_index*: the index of the winning coroutine in
          ``coro_fns``, or ``None`` if no coroutines won. If the winning
          coroutine may return None on success, *winner_index* can be used
          to definitively determine whether any coroutine won.

        - *exceptions*: list of exceptions returned by the coroutines.
          ``len(exceptions)`` is equal to the number of coroutines actually
          started, and the order is the same as in ``coro_fns``. The winning
          coroutine's entry is ``None``.

Basic statistics module.

This module provides functions for calculating statistics of data, including
averages, variance, and standard deviation.

Calculating averages
--------------------

==================  ==================================================
Function            Description
==================  ==================================================
mean                Arithmetic mean (average) of data.
fmean               Fast, floating point arithmetic mean.
geometric_mean      Geometric mean of data.
harmonic_mean       Harmonic mean of data.
median              Median (middle value) of data.
median_low          Low median of data.
median_high         High median of data.
median_grouped      Median, or 50th percentile, of grouped data.
mode                Mode (most common value) of data.
multimode           List of modes (most common values of data).
quantiles           Divide data into intervals with equal probability.
==================  ==================================================

Calculate the arithmetic mean ("the average") of data:

>>> mean([-1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 5.75])
2.625


Calculate the standard median of discrete data:

>>> median([2, 3, 4, 5])
3.5


Calculate the median, or 50th percentile, of data grouped into class intervals
centred on the data values provided. E.g. if your data points are rounded to
the nearest whole number:

>>> median_grouped([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
2.8333333333...

This should be interpreted in this way: you have two data points in the class
interval 1.5-2.5, three data points in the class interval 2.5-3.5, and one in
the class interval 3.5-4.5. The median of these data points is 2.8333...


Calculating variability or spread
---------------------------------

==================  =============================================
Function            Description
==================  =============================================
pvariance           Population variance of data.
variance            Sample variance of data.
pstdev              Population standard deviation of data.
stdev               Sample standard deviation of data.
==================  =============================================

Calculate the standard deviation of sample data:

>>> stdev([2.5, 3.25, 5.5, 11.25, 11.75])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
4.38961843444...

If you have previously calculated the mean, you can pass it as the optional
second argument to the four "spread" functions to avoid recalculating it:

>>> data = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
>>> mu = mean(data)
>>> pvariance(data, mu)
2.5


Statistics for relations between two inputs
-------------------------------------------

==================  ====================================================
Function            Description
==================  ====================================================
covariance          Sample covariance for two variables.
correlation         Pearson's correlation coefficient for two variables.
linear_regression   Intercept and slope for simple linear regression.
==================  ====================================================

Calculate covariance, Pearson's correlation, and simple linear regression
for two inputs:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>> covariance(x, y)
0.75
>>> correlation(x, y)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
0.31622776601...
>>> linear_regression(x, y)  #doctest:
LinearRegression(slope=0.1, intercept=1.5)


Exceptions
----------

A single exception is defined: StatisticsError is a subclass of ValueError.

''NormalDist''StatisticsError''correlation''covariance''geometric_mean''harmonic_mean''linear_regression''median''median_grouped''median_high''median_low''multimode''pstdev''pvariance''quantiles''variance''_sum(data) -> (type, sum, count)

    Return a high-precision sum of the given numeric data as a fraction,
    together with the type to be converted to and the count of items.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> _sum([3, 2.25, 4.5, -0.5, 0.25])
    (<class 'float'>, Fraction(19, 2), 5)

    Some sources of round-off error will be avoided:

    # Built-in sum returns zero.
    >>> _sum([1e50, 1, -1e50] * 1000)
    (<class 'float'>, Fraction(1000, 1), 3000)

    Fractions and Decimals are also supported:

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> _sum([F(2, 3), F(7, 5), F(1, 4), F(5, 6)])
    (<class 'fractions.Fraction'>, Fraction(63, 20), 4)

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> data = [D("0.1375"), D("0.2108"), D("0.3061"), D("0.0419")]
    >>> _sum(data)
    (<class 'decimal.Decimal'>, Fraction(6963, 10000), 4)

    Mixed types are currently treated as an error, except that int is
    allowed.
    ''Return the exact mean and sum of square deviations of sequence data.

    Calculations are done in a single pass, allowing the input to be an iterator.

    If given *c* is used the mean; otherwise, it is calculated from the data.
    Use the *c* argument with care, as it can lead to garbage results.

    ''Coerce types T and S to a common type, or raise TypeError.

    Coercion rules are currently an implementation detail. See the CoerceTest
    test class in test_statistics for details.
    ''initial type T is bool''don't know how to coerce %s and %s''Return Real number x to exact (numerator, denominator) pair.

    >>> _exact_ratio(0.25)
    (1, 4)

    x is expected to be an int, Fraction, Decimal or float.
    ''can't convert type '''' to numerator/denominator''Convert value to given numeric type T.''negative value''Iterate over values, failing if any are less than zero.''average''Rank order a dataset. The lowest value has rank 1.

    Ties are averaged so that equal values receive the same rank:

        >>> data = [31, 56, 31, 25, 75, 18]
        >>> _rank(data)
        [3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 6.0, 1.0]

    The operation is idempotent:

        >>> _rank([3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 6.0, 1.0])
        [3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.0, 6.0, 1.0]

    It is possible to rank the data in reverse order so that the
    highest value has rank 1.  Also, a key-function can extract
    the field to be ranked:

        >>> goals = [('eagles', 45), ('bears', 48), ('lions', 44)]
        >>> _rank(goals, key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
        [2.0, 1.0, 3.0]

    Ranks are conventionally numbered starting from one; however,
    setting *start* to zero allows the ranks to be used as array indices:

        >>> prize = ['Gold', 'Silver', 'Bronze', 'Certificate']
        >>> scores = [8.1, 7.3, 9.4, 8.3]
        >>> [prize[int(i)] for i in _rank(scores, start=0, reverse=True)]
        ['Bronze', 'Certificate', 'Gold', 'Silver']

    ''Unknown tie resolution method: ''Square root of n/m, rounded to the nearest integer using round-to-odd.''Square root of n/m as a float, correctly rounded.''Square root of n/m as a Decimal, correctly rounded.''Return the sample arithmetic mean of data.

    >>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
    2.8

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> mean([F(3, 7), F(1, 21), F(5, 3), F(1, 3)])
    Fraction(13, 21)

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> mean([D("0.5"), D("0.75"), D("0.625"), D("0.375")])
    Decimal('0.5625')

    If ``data`` is empty, StatisticsError will be raised.
    ''mean requires at least one data point''Convert data to floats and compute the arithmetic mean.

    This runs faster than the mean() function and it always returns a float.
    If the input dataset is empty, it raises a StatisticsError.

    >>> fmean([3.5, 4.0, 5.25])
    4.25
    ''fmean requires at least one data point''data and weights must be the same length''sum of weights must be non-zero''Convert data to floats and compute the geometric mean.

    Raises a StatisticsError if the input dataset is empty,
    if it contains a zero, or if it contains a negative value.

    No special efforts are made to achieve exact results.
    (However, this may change in the future.)

    >>> round(geometric_mean([54, 24, 36]), 9)
    36.0
    ''geometric mean requires a non-empty dataset containing positive numbers''Return the harmonic mean of data.

    The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the
    reciprocals of the data.  It can be used for averaging ratios or
    rates, for example speeds.

    Suppose a car travels 40 km/hr for 5 km and then speeds-up to
    60 km/hr for another 5 km. What is the average speed?

        >>> harmonic_mean([40, 60])
        48.0

    Suppose a car travels 40 km/hr for 5 km, and when traffic clears,
    speeds-up to 60 km/hr for the remaining 30 km of the journey. What
    is the average speed?

        >>> harmonic_mean([40, 60], weights=[5, 30])
        56.0

    If ``data`` is empty, or any element is less than zero,
    ``harmonic_mean`` will raise ``StatisticsError``.
    ''harmonic mean does not support negative values''harmonic_mean requires at least one data point''unsupported type''Number of weights does not match data size''Weighted sum must be positive''Return the median (middle value) of numeric data.

    When the number of data points is odd, return the middle data point.
    When the number of data points is even, the median is interpolated by
    taking the average of the two middle values:

    >>> median([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median([1, 3, 5, 7])
    4.0

    ''no median for empty data''Return the low median of numeric data.

    When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
    When it is even, the smaller of the two middle values is returned.

    >>> median_low([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median_low([1, 3, 5, 7])
    3

    ''Return the high median of data.

    When the number of data points is odd, the middle value is returned.
    When it is even, the larger of the two middle values is returned.

    >>> median_high([1, 3, 5])
    3
    >>> median_high([1, 3, 5, 7])
    5

    ''Estimates the median for numeric data binned around the midpoints
    of consecutive, fixed-width intervals.

    The *data* can be any iterable of numeric data with each value being
    exactly the midpoint of a bin.  At least one value must be present.

    The *interval* is width of each bin.

    For example, demographic information may have been summarized into
    consecutive ten-year age groups with each group being represented
    by the 5-year midpoints of the intervals:

        >>> demographics = Counter({
        ...    25: 172,   # 20 to 30 years old
        ...    35: 484,   # 30 to 40 years old
        ...    45: 387,   # 40 to 50 years old
        ...    55:  22,   # 50 to 60 years old
        ...    65:   6,   # 60 to 70 years old
        ... })

    The 50th percentile (median) is the 536th person out of the 1071
    member cohort.  That person is in the 30 to 40 year old age group.

    The regular median() function would assume that everyone in the
    tricenarian age group was exactly 35 years old.  A more tenable
    assumption is that the 484 members of that age group are evenly
    distributed between 30 and 40.  For that, we use median_grouped().

        >>> data = list(demographics.elements())
        >>> median(data)
        35
        >>> round(median_grouped(data, interval=10), 1)
        37.5

    The caller is responsible for making sure the data points are separated
    by exact multiples of *interval*.  This is essential for getting a
    correct result.  The function does not check this precondition.

    Inputs may be any numeric type that can be coerced to a float during
    the interpolation step.

    ''Value cannot be converted to a float''Return the most common data point from discrete or nominal data.

    ``mode`` assumes discrete data, and returns a single value. This is the
    standard treatment of the mode as commonly taught in schools:

        >>> mode([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4])
        3

    This also works with nominal (non-numeric) data:

        >>> mode(["red", "blue", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "red"])
        'red'

    If there are multiple modes with same frequency, return the first one
    encountered:

        >>> mode(['red', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'blue'])
        'red'

    If *data* is empty, ``mode``, raises StatisticsError.

    ''no mode for empty data''Return a list of the most frequently occurring values.

    Will return more than one result if there are multiple modes
    or an empty list if *data* is empty.

    >>> multimode('aabbbbbbbbcc')
    ['b']
    >>> multimode('aabbbbccddddeeffffgg')
    ['b', 'd', 'f']
    >>> multimode('')
    []
    ''exclusive''Divide *data* into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

    Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

    Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
    Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
    separate *data* in to 100 equal sized groups.

    The *data* can be any iterable containing sample.
    The cut points are linearly interpolated between data points.

    If *method* is set to *inclusive*, *data* is treated as population
    data.  The minimum value is treated as the 0th percentile and the
    maximum value is treated as the 100th percentile.
    ''n must be at least 1''must have at least two data points''inclusive''Unknown method: ''Return the sample variance of data.

    data should be an iterable of Real-valued numbers, with at least two
    values. The optional argument xbar, if given, should be the mean of
    the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.

    Use this function when your data is a sample from a population. To
    calculate the variance from the entire population, see ``pvariance``.

    Examples:

    >>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]
    >>> variance(data)
    1.3720238095238095

    If you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as
    the optional second argument ``xbar`` to avoid recalculating it:

    >>> m = mean(data)
    >>> variance(data, m)
    1.3720238095238095

    This function does not check that ``xbar`` is actually the mean of
    ``data``. Giving arbitrary values for ``xbar`` may lead to invalid or
    impossible results.

    Decimals and Fractions are supported:

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> variance([D("27.5"), D("30.25"), D("30.25"), D("34.5"), D("41.75")])
    Decimal('31.01875')

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> variance([F(1, 6), F(1, 2), F(5, 3)])
    Fraction(67, 108)

    ''variance requires at least two data points''Return the population variance of ``data``.

    data should be a sequence or iterable of Real-valued numbers, with at least one
    value. The optional argument mu, if given, should be the mean of
    the data. If it is missing or None, the mean is automatically calculated.

    Use this function to calculate the variance from the entire population.
    To estimate the variance from a sample, the ``variance`` function is
    usually a better choice.

    Examples:

    >>> data = [0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.75, 3.25]
    >>> pvariance(data)
    1.25

    If you have already calculated the mean of the data, you can pass it as
    the optional second argument to avoid recalculating it:

    >>> mu = mean(data)
    >>> pvariance(data, mu)
    1.25

    Decimals and Fractions are supported:

    >>> from decimal import Decimal as D
    >>> pvariance([D("27.5"), D("30.25"), D("30.25"), D("34.5"), D("41.75")])
    Decimal('24.815')

    >>> from fractions import Fraction as F
    >>> pvariance([F(1, 4), F(5, 4), F(1, 2)])
    Fraction(13, 72)

    ''pvariance requires at least one data point''Return the square root of the sample variance.

    See ``variance`` for arguments and other details.

    >>> stdev([1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 4.75])
    1.0810874155219827

    ''stdev requires at least two data points''Return the square root of the population variance.

    See ``pvariance`` for arguments and other details.

    >>> pstdev([1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 4.75])
    0.986893273527251

    ''pstdev requires at least one data point''In one pass, compute the mean and sample standard deviation as floats.''Covariance

    Return the sample covariance of two inputs *x* and *y*. Covariance
    is a measure of the joint variability of two inputs.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    >>> y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
    >>> covariance(x, y)
    0.75
    >>> z = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> covariance(x, z)
    -7.5
    >>> covariance(z, x)
    -7.5

    ''covariance requires that both inputs have same number of data points''covariance requires at least two data points''linear''Pearson's correlation coefficient

    Return the Pearson's correlation coefficient for two inputs. Pearson's
    correlation coefficient *r* takes values between -1 and +1. It measures
    the strength and direction of a linear relationship.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    >>> y = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> correlation(x, x)
    1.0
    >>> correlation(x, y)
    -1.0

    If *method* is "ranked", computes Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
    for two inputs.  The data is replaced by ranks.  Ties are averaged
    so that equal values receive the same rank.  The resulting coefficient
    measures the strength of a monotonic relationship.

    Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is appropriate for ordinal
    data or for continuous data that doesn't meet the linear proportion
    requirement for Pearson's correlation coefficient.
    ''correlation requires that both inputs have same number of data points''correlation requires at least two data points''ranked''at least one of the inputs is constant''LinearRegression''slope''intercept''Slope and intercept for simple linear regression.

    Return the slope and intercept of simple linear regression
    parameters estimated using ordinary least squares. Simple linear
    regression describes relationship between an independent variable
    *x* and a dependent variable *y* in terms of a linear function:

        y = slope * x + intercept + noise

    where *slope* and *intercept* are the regression parameters that are
    estimated, and noise represents the variability of the data that was
    not explained by the linear regression (it is equal to the
    difference between predicted and actual values of the dependent
    variable).

    The parameters are returned as a named tuple.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> noise = NormalDist().samples(5, seed=42)
    >>> y = [3 * x[i] + 2 + noise[i] for i in range(5)]
    >>> linear_regression(x, y)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    LinearRegression(slope=3.09078914170..., intercept=1.75684970486...)

    If *proportional* is true, the independent variable *x* and the
    dependent variable *y* are assumed to be directly proportional.
    The data is fit to a line passing through the origin.

    Since the *intercept* will always be 0.0, the underlying linear
    function simplifies to:

        y = slope * x + noise

    >>> y = [3 * x[i] + noise[i] for i in range(5)]
    >>> linear_regression(x, y, proportional=True)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    LinearRegression(slope=3.02447542484..., intercept=0.0)

P(x <= X < x+dx) / dx''pdf() not defined when sigma is zero''Cumulative distribution function.  P(X <= x)''cdf() not defined when sigma is zero''Inverse cumulative distribution function.  x : P(X <= x) = p

        Finds the value of the random variable such that the probability of
        the variable being less than or equal to that value equals the given
        probability.

        This function is also called the percent point function or quantile
        function.
        ''p must be in the range 0.0 < p < 1.0''Divide into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

        Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

        Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
        Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
        separate the normal distribution in to 100 equal sized groups.
        ''Compute the overlapping coefficient (OVL) between two normal distributions.

        Measures the agreement between two normal probability distributions.
        Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 giving the overlapping area in
        the two underlying probability density functions.

            >>> N1 = NormalDist(2.4, 1.6)
            >>> N2 = NormalDist(3.2, 2.0)
            >>> N1.overlap(N2)
            0.8035050657330205
        ''Expected another NormalDist instance''overlap() not defined when sigma is zero''Compute the Standard Score.  (x - mean) / stdev

        Describes *x* in terms of the number of standard deviations
        above or below the mean of the normal distribution.
        ''zscore() not defined when sigma is zero''Arithmetic mean of the normal distribution.''Return the median of the normal distribution''Return the mode of the normal distribution

        The mode is the value x where which the probability density
        function (pdf) takes its maximum value.
        ''Standard deviation of the normal distribution.''Square of the standard deviation.''Add a constant or another NormalDist instance.

        If *other* is a constant, translate mu by the constant,
        leaving sigma unchanged.

        If *other* is a NormalDist, add both the means and the variances.
        Mathematically, this works only if the two distributions are
        independent or if they are jointly normally distributed.
        ''Subtract a constant or another NormalDist instance.

        If *other* is a constant, translate by the constant mu,
        leaving sigma unchanged.

        If *other* is a NormalDist, subtract the means and add the variances.

    The reader returned is a StreamReader instance; the writer is a
    StreamWriter instance.

    The arguments are all the usual arguments to create_connection()
    except protocol_factory; most common are positional host and port,
    with various optional keyword arguments following.

    Additional optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop
    instance to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader).

    (If you want to customize the StreamReader and/or
    StreamReaderProtocol classes, just copy the code -- there's
    really nothing special here except some convenience.)
    ''Start a socket server, call back for each client connected.

    The first parameter, `client_connected_cb`, takes two parameters:
    client_reader, client_writer.  client_reader is a StreamReader
    object, while client_writer is a StreamWriter object.  This
    parameter can either be a plain callback function or a coroutine;
    if it is a coroutine, it will be automatically converted into a
    Task.

    The rest of the arguments are all the usual arguments to
    loop.create_server() except protocol_factory; most common are
    positional host and port, with various optional keyword arguments
    following.  The return value is the same as loop.create_server().

    Additional optional keyword argument is limit (to set the buffer
    limit passed to the StreamReader).

    The return value is the same as loop.create_server(), i.e. a
    Server object which can be used to stop the service.
    ''Similar to `open_connection` but works with UNIX Domain Sockets.''Similar to `start_server` but works with UNIX Domain Sockets.''Reusable flow control logic for StreamWriter.drain().

    This implements the protocol methods pause_writing(),
    resume_writing() and connection_lost().  If the subclass overrides
    these it must call the super methods.

    StreamWriter.drain() must wait for _drain_helper() coroutine.
    ''%r pauses writing''%r resumes writing''Connection lost''Helper class to adapt between Protocol and StreamReader.

    (This is a helper class instead of making StreamReader itself a
    Protocol subclass, because the StreamReader has other potential
    uses, and to prevent the user of the StreamReader to accidentally
    call inappropriate methods of the protocol.)
    ''An open stream was garbage collected prior to establishing network connection; call "stream.close()" explicitly.''Unhandled exception in client_connected_cb''Wraps a Transport.

    This exposes write(), writelines(), [can_]write_eof(),
    get_extra_info() and close().  It adds drain() which returns an
    optional Future on which you can wait for flow control.  It also
    adds a transport property which references the Transport
    directly.
    ''transport=''reader=''Flush the write buffer.

        The intended use is to write

        ''() called while another coroutine is already waiting for incoming data''_wait_for_data after EOF''Read chunk of data from the stream until newline (b'
') is found.

        On success, return chunk that ends with newline. If only partial
        line can be read due to EOF, return incomplete line without
        terminating newline. When EOF was reached while no bytes read, empty
        bytes object is returned.

        If limit is reached, ValueError will be raised. In that case, if
        newline was found, complete line including newline will be removed
        from internal buffer. Else, internal buffer will be cleared. Limit is
        compared against part of the line without newline.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.
        ''readuntil''Read data from the stream until ``separator`` is found.

        On success, the data and separator will be removed from the
        internal buffer (consumed). Returned data will include the
        separator at the end.

        Configured stream limit is used to check result. Limit sets the
        maximal length of data that can be returned, not counting the
        separator.

        If an EOF occurs and the complete separator is still not found,
        an IncompleteReadError exception will be raised, and the internal
        buffer will be reset.  The IncompleteReadError.partial attribute
        may contain the separator partially.

        If the data cannot be read because of over limit, a
        LimitOverrunError exception  will be raised, and the data
        will be left in the internal buffer, so it can be read again.
        ''Separator should be at least one-byte string''Separator is not found, and chunk exceed the limit''Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit''Read up to `n` bytes from the stream.

        If `n` is not provided or set to -1,
        read until EOF, then return all read bytes.
        If EOF was received and the internal buffer is empty,
        return an empty bytes object.

        If `n` is 0, return an empty bytes object immediately.

        If `n` is positive, return at most `n` available bytes
        as soon as at least 1 byte is available in the internal buffer.
        If EOF is received before any byte is read, return an empty
        bytes object.

        Returned value is not limited with limit, configured at stream
        creation.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.
        ''readexactly''Read exactly `n` bytes.

        Raise an IncompleteReadError if EOF is reached before `n` bytes can be
        read. The IncompleteReadError.partial attribute of the exception will
        contain the partial read bytes.

        if n is zero, return empty bytes object.

        Returned value is not limited with limit, configured at stream
        creation.

        If stream was paused, this function will automatically resume it if
        needed.

This module allows you to spawn processes, connect to their
input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

For a complete description of this module see the Python documentation.

Main API
========
run(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns a
          CompletedProcess instance.
Popen(...): A class for flexibly executing a command in a new process

Constants
---------
DEVNULL: Special value that indicates that os.devnull should be used
PIPE:    Special value that indicates a pipe should be created
STDOUT:  Special value that indicates that stderr should go to stdout


Older API
=========
call(...): Runs a command, waits for it to complete, then returns
    the return code.
check_call(...): Same as call() but raises CalledProcessError()
    if return code is not 0
check_output(...): Same as check_call() but returns the contents of
    stdout instead of a return code
getoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
    then returns the output
getstatusoutput(...): Runs a command in the shell, waits for it to complete,
    then returns a (exitcode, output) tuple
''check_call''getstatusoutput''getoutput''SubprocessError''TimeoutExpired''CompletedProcess''wasi''STARTUPINFO''Raised when run() is called with check=True and the process
    returns a non-zero exit status.

    Attributes:
      cmd, returncode, stdout, stderr, output
    ''Command '%s' died with %r.''Command '%s' died with unknown signal %d.''Command '%s' returned non-zero exit status %d.''Alias for output attribute, to match stderr''This exception is raised when the timeout expires while waiting for a
    child process.

    Attributes:
        cmd, output, stdout, stderr, timeout
    ''Command '%s' timed out after %s seconds''handle_list''already closed''%s(%d)''PIPE_BUF''Return a list of command-line arguments reproducing the current
    optimization settings in sys.flags.''Return a list of command-line arguments reproducing the current
    settings in sys.flags, sys.warnoptions and sys._xoptions.''-I''-E''-P''error::BytesWarning''default::BytesWarning''-W''-X''faulthandler''tracemalloc''importtime''frozen_modules''showrefcount'''encoding' argument not specified.''Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete or
    timeout, then return the returncode attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:

    retcode = call(["ls", "-l"])
    ''Run command with arguments.  Wait for command to complete.  If
    the exit code was zero then return, otherwise raise
    CalledProcessError.  The CalledProcessError object will have the
    return code in the returncode attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the call function.  Example:

    check_call(["ls", "-l"])
    ''Run command with arguments and return its output.

    If the exit code was non-zero it raises a CalledProcessError.  The
    CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode
    attribute and output in the output attribute.

    The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.  Example:

    >>> check_output(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"])
    b'crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Oct 18  2007 /dev/null\n'

    The stdout argument is not allowed as it is used internally.
    To capture standard error in the result, use stderr=STDOUT.

    >>> check_output(["/bin/sh", "-c",
    ...               "ls -l non_existent_file ; exit 0"],
    ...              stderr=STDOUT)
    b'ls: non_existent_file: No such file or directory\n'

    There is an additional optional argument, "input", allowing you to
    pass a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
    you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
    it too will be used internally.  Example:

    >>> check_output(["sed", "-e", "s/foo/bar/"],
    ...              input=b"when in the course of fooman events\n")
    b'when in the course of barman events\n'

    By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input"
    should be bytes, and the return value will be bytes.  If in text mode,
    any "input" should be a string, and the return value will be a string
    decoded according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
    is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.
    '' argument not allowed, it will be overridden.''A process that has finished running.

    This is returned by run().

    Attributes:
      args: The list or str args passed to run().
      returncode: The exit code of the process, negative for signals.
      stdout: The standard output (None if not captured).
      stderr: The standard error (None if not captured).
    ''args={!r}''returncode={!r}''stdout={!r}''stderr={!r}''Raise CalledProcessError if the exit code is non-zero.''Run command with arguments and return a CompletedProcess instance.

    The returned instance will have attributes args, returncode, stdout and
    stderr. By default, stdout and stderr are not captured, and those attributes
    will be None. Pass stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE in order to capture them,
    or pass capture_output=True to capture both.

    If check is True and the exit code was non-zero, it raises a
    CalledProcessError. The CalledProcessError object will have the return code
    in the returncode attribute, and output & stderr attributes if those streams
    were captured.

    If timeout is given, and the process takes too long, a TimeoutExpired
    exception will be raised.

    There is an optional argument "input", allowing you to
    pass bytes or a string to the subprocess's stdin.  If you use this argument
    you may not also use the Popen constructor's "stdin" argument, as
    it will be used internally.

    By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any "input" should
    be bytes, and the stdout and stderr will be bytes. If in text mode, any
    "input" should be a string, and stdout and stderr will be strings decoded
    according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode is
    triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or universal_newlines.

    The other arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor.
    ''stdin and input arguments may not both be used.''stdout and stderr arguments may not be used with capture_output.''
    Translate a sequence of arguments into a command line
    string, using the same rules as the MS C runtime:

    1) Arguments are delimited by white space, which is either a
       space or a tab.

    2) A string surrounded by double quotation marks is
       interpreted as a single argument, regardless of white space
       contained within.  A quoted string can be embedded in an
       argument.

    3) A double quotation mark preceded by a backslash is
       interpreted as a literal double quotation mark.

    4) Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they
       immediately precede a double quotation mark.

    5) If backslashes immediately precede a double quotation mark,
       every pair of backslashes is interpreted as a literal
       backslash.  If the number of backslashes is odd, the last
       backslash escapes the next double quotation mark as
       described in rule 3.
    ''Return (exitcode, output) of executing cmd in a shell.

    Execute the string 'cmd' in a shell with 'check_output' and
    return a 2-tuple (status, output). The locale encoding is used
    to decode the output and process newlines.

    A trailing newline is stripped from the output.
    The exit status for the command can be interpreted
    according to the rules for the function 'wait'. Example:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    (0, '/bin/ls')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('cat /bin/junk')
    (1, 'cat: /bin/junk: No such file or directory')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/junk')
    (127, 'sh: /bin/junk: not found')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/kill $$')
    (-15, '')
    ''Return output (stdout or stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.

    Like getstatusoutput(), except the exit status is ignored and the return
    value is a string containing the command's output.  Example:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> subprocess.getoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    '/bin/ls'
    ''Check if posix_spawn() can be used for subprocess.

    subprocess requires a posix_spawn() implementation that properly reports
    errors to the parent process, & sets errno on the following failures:

    * Process attribute actions failed.
    * File actions failed.
    * exec() failed.

    Prefer an implementation which can use vfork() in some cases for best
    performance.
    ''posix_spawn''sunos5'' Execute a child program in a new process.

    For a complete description of the arguments see the Python documentation.

    Arguments:
      args: A string, or a sequence of program arguments.

      bufsize: supplied as the buffering argument to the open() function when
          creating the stdin/stdout/stderr pipe file objects

      executable: A replacement program to execute.

      stdin, stdout and stderr: These specify the executed programs' standard
          input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.

      preexec_fn: (POSIX only) An object to be called in the child process
          just before the child is executed.

      close_fds: Controls closing or inheriting of file descriptors.

      shell: If true, the command will be executed through the shell.

      cwd: Sets the current directory before the child is executed.

      env: Defines the environment variables for the new process.

      text: If true, decode stdin, stdout and stderr using the given encoding
          (if set) or the system default otherwise.

      universal_newlines: Alias of text, provided for backwards compatibility.

      startupinfo and creationflags (Windows only)

      restore_signals (POSIX only)

      start_new_session (POSIX only)

      process_group (POSIX only)

      group (POSIX only)

      extra_groups (POSIX only)

      umask (POSIX only)

      pass_fds (POSIX only)

      encoding and errors: Text mode encoding and error handling to use for
          file objects stdin, stdout and stderr.

    Attributes:

        Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is
        reached.  Wait for process to terminate.

        The optional "input" argument should be data to be sent to the
        child process, or None, if no data should be sent to the child.
        communicate() returns a tuple (stdout, stderr).

        By default, all communication is in bytes, and therefore any
        "input" should be bytes, and the (stdout, stderr) will be bytes.
        If in text mode (indicated by self.text_mode), any "input" should
        be a string, and (stdout, stderr) will be strings decoded
        according to locale encoding, or by "encoding" if set. Text mode
        is triggered by setting any of text, encoding, errors or
        universal_newlines.

    Example use:

            task2 = group.create_task(other_coroutine(...))
        print("Both tasks have completed now.")

    All tasks are awaited when the context manager exits.

    Any exceptions other than `asyncio.CancelledError` raised within
    a task will cancel all remaining tasks and wait for them to exit.
    The exceptions are then combined and raised as an `ExceptionGroup`.

        If the coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is
        suspended.  If the coroutine has completed successfully or was
        cancelled, this returns an empty list.  If the coroutine was
        terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback
        frames.

        The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

        The optional limit gives the maximum number of frames to
        return; by default all available frames are returned.  Its
        meaning differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is
        returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the
        oldest frames of a traceback are returned.  (This matches the
        behavior of the traceback module.)

        For reasons beyond our control, only one stack frame is
        returned for a suspended coroutine.
        ''Print the stack or traceback for this task's coroutine.

        This produces output similar to that of the traceback module,
        for the frames retrieved by get_stack().  The limit argument
        is passed to get_stack().  The file argument is an I/O stream
        to which the output is written; by default output is written
        to sys.stderr.
        ''Request that this task cancel itself.

        This arranges for a CancelledError to be thrown into the
        wrapped coroutine on the next cycle through the event loop.
        The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny
        the request using try/except/finally.

        Unlike Future.cancel, this does not guarantee that the
        task will be cancelled: the exception might be caught and
        acted upon, delaying cancellation of the task or preventing
        cancellation completely.  The task may also return a value or
        raise a different exception.

        Immediately after this method is called, Task.cancelled() will
        not return True (unless the task was already cancelled).  A
        task will be marked as cancelled when the wrapped coroutine
        terminates with a CancelledError exception (even if cancel()
        was not called).

        This also increases the task's count of cancellation requests.
        ''Return the count of the task's cancellation requests.

        This count is incremented when .cancel() is called
        and may be decremented using .uncancel().
        ''Decrement the task's count of cancellation requests.

        This should be called by the party that called `cancel()` on the task

    ''Wait for the Futures or Tasks given by fs to complete.

    Returns two sets of Future: (done, pending).

    Usage:

        done, pending = await asyncio.wait(fs)

    Note: This does not raise TimeoutError! Futures that aren't done
    when the timeout occurs are returned in the second set.

    Coroutine will be wrapped in Task.

    Returns result of the Future or coroutine.  When a timeout occurs,
    it cancels the task and raises TimeoutError.  To avoid the task
    cancellation, wrap it in shield().

    If the wait is cancelled, the task is also cancelled.

    If the task suppresses the cancellation and returns a value instead,
    that value is returned.

    This function is a coroutine.
    ''Internal helper for wait().

    The fs argument must be a collection of Futures.
    ''Set of Futures is empty.''Cancel the *fut* future or task and wait until it completes.''Return an iterator whose values are coroutines.

    When waiting for the yielded coroutines you'll get the results (or
    exceptions!) of the original Futures (or coroutines), in the order
    in which and as soon as they complete.

    This differs from PEP 3148; the proper way to use this is:

        for f in as_completed(fs):
            result = await f  # The 'await' may raise.
            # Use result.

    If a timeout is specified, the 'await' will raise
    TimeoutError when the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

    Note: The futures 'f' are not necessarily members of fs.
    ''expect an iterable of futures, not ''Skip one event loop run cycle.

    This is a private helper for 'asyncio.sleep()', used
    when the 'delay' is set to 0.  It uses a bare 'yield'
    expression (which Task.__step knows how to handle)
    instead of creating a Future object.
    ''Coroutine that completes after a given time (in seconds).''Wrap a coroutine or an awaitable in a future.

    If the argument is a Future, it is returned directly.
    ''The future belongs to a different loop than the one specified as the loop argument''An asyncio.Future, a coroutine or an awaitable is required''Helper for gather().

    This overrides cancel() to cancel all the children and act more
    like Task.cancel(), which doesn't immediately mark itself as
    cancelled.
    ''Return a future aggregating results from the given coroutines/futures.

    Coroutines will be wrapped in a future and scheduled in the event
    loop. They will not necessarily be scheduled in the same order as
    passed in.

    All futures must share the same event loop.  If all the tasks are
    done successfully, the returned future's result is the list of
    results (in the order of the original sequence, not necessarily
    the order of results arrival).  If *return_exceptions* is True,
    exceptions in the tasks are treated the same as successful
    results, and gathered in the result list; otherwise, the first
    raised exception will be immediately propagated to the returned
    future.

    Cancellation: if the outer Future is cancelled, all children (that
    have not completed yet) are also cancelled.  If any child is
    cancelled, this is treated as if it raised CancelledError --
    the outer Future is *not* cancelled in this case.  (This is to
    prevent the cancellation of one child to cause other children to
    be cancelled.)

    If *return_exceptions* is False, cancelling gather() after it
    has been marked done won't cancel any submitted awaitables.
    For instance, gather can be marked done after propagating an
    exception to the caller, therefore, calling ``gather.cancel()``
    after catching an exception (raised by one of the awaitables) from
    gather won't cancel any other awaitables.
    ''Wait for a future, shielding it from cancellation.

    The statement

        task = asyncio.create_task(something())
        res = await shield(task)

    is exactly equivalent to the statement

        res = await something()

    *except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the
    task running in something() is not cancelled.  From the POV of
    something(), the cancellation did not happen.  But its caller is
    still cancelled, so the yield-from expression still raises
    CancelledError.  Note: If something() is cancelled by other means
    this will still cancel shield().

    If you want to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended)
    you can combine shield() with a try/except clause, as follows:

        task = asyncio.create_task(something())
        try:
            res = await shield(task)
        except CancelledError:
            res = None

    Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid
    a task disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps
    weak references to tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere
    may get garbage collected at any time, even before it's done.
    ''Submit a coroutine object to a given event loop.

    Return a concurrent.futures.Future to access the result.

            loop.set_task_factory(

        Now, tasks created will be started immediately (rather than being first
        scheduled to an event loop). The constructor argument can be any callable
        that returns a Task-compatible object and has a signature compatible
        with `Task.__init__`; it must have the `eager_start` keyword argument.

        Most applications will use `Task` for `custom_task_constructor` and in
        this case there's no need to call `create_eager_task_factory()`
        directly. Instead the  global `eager_task_factory` instance can be
        used. E.g. `loop.set_task_factory(asyncio.eager_task_factory)`.

This module provides generic, low- and high-level interfaces for
creating temporary files and directories.  All of the interfaces
provided by this module can be used without fear of race conditions
except for 'mktemp'.  'mktemp' is subject to race conditions and
should not be used; it is provided for backward compatibility only.

The default path names are returned as str.  If you supply bytes as
input, all return values will be in bytes.  Ex:

    >>> tempfile.mkstemp()
    (4, '/tmp/tmptpu9nin8')
    >>> tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=b'')
    b'/tmp/tmppbi8f0hy'

This module also provides some data items to the user:

  TMP_MAX  - maximum number of names that will be tried before
             giving up.
  tempdir  - If this is set to a string before the first use of
             any routine from this module, it will be considered as
             another candidate location to store temporary files.

''Text wrapping and filling.
''TextWrapper''dedent''shorten''	
 ''
    Object for wrapping/filling text.  The public interface consists of
    the wrap() and fill() methods; the other methods are just there for
    subclasses to override in order to tweak the default behaviour.
    If you want to completely replace the main wrapping algorithm,
    you'll probably have to override _wrap_chunks().

    Several instance attributes control various aspects of wrapping:
      width (default: 70)
        the maximum width of wrapped lines (unless break_long_words
        is false)
      initial_indent (default: "")
        string that will be prepended to the first line of wrapped
        output.  Counts towards the line's width.
      subsequent_indent (default: "")
        string that will be prepended to all lines save the first
        of wrapped output; also counts towards each line's width.
      expand_tabs (default: true)
        Expand tabs in input text to spaces before further processing.
        Each tab will become 0 .. 'tabsize' spaces, depending on its position
        in its line.  If false, each tab is treated as a single character.
      tabsize (default: 8)
        Expand tabs in input text to 0 .. 'tabsize' spaces, unless
        'expand_tabs' is false.
      replace_whitespace (default: true)
        Replace all whitespace characters in the input text by spaces
        after tab expansion.  Note that if expand_tabs is false and
        replace_whitespace is true, every tab will be converted to a
        single space!
      fix_sentence_endings (default: false)
        Ensure that sentence-ending punctuation is always followed
        by two spaces.  Off by default because the algorithm is
        (unavoidably) imperfect.
      break_long_words (default: true)
        Break words longer than 'width'.  If false, those words will not
        be broken, and some lines might be longer than 'width'.
      break_on_hyphens (default: true)
        Allow breaking hyphenated words. If true, wrapping will occur
        preferably on whitespaces and right after hyphens part of
        compound words.
      drop_whitespace (default: true)
        Drop leading and trailing whitespace from lines.
      max_lines (default: None)
        Truncate wrapped lines.
      placeholder (default: ' [...]')
        Append to the last line of truncated text.

            )
        )''wp''nws''(%s+)''[a-z][\.\!\?][\"\']?\Z'' [...]''_munge_whitespace(text : string) -> string

        Munge whitespace in text: expand tabs and convert all other
        whitespace characters to spaces.  Eg. " foo\tbar\n\nbaz"
        becomes " foo    bar  baz".
        ''_split(text : string) -> [string]

        Split the text to wrap into indivisible chunks.  Chunks are
        not quite the same as words; see _wrap_chunks() for full
        details.  As an example, the text
          Look, goof-ball -- use the -b option!
        breaks into the following chunks:
          'Look,', ' ', 'goof-', 'ball', ' ', '--', ' ',
          'use', ' ', 'the', ' ', '-b', ' ', 'option!'
        if break_on_hyphens is True, or in:
          'Look,', ' ', 'goof-ball', ' ', '--', ' ',
          'use', ' ', 'the', ' ', '-b', ' ', option!'
        otherwise.
        ''_fix_sentence_endings(chunks : [string])

        Correct for sentence endings buried in 'chunks'.  Eg. when the
        original text contains "... foo.\nBar ...", munge_whitespace()
        and split() will convert that to [..., "foo.", " ", "Bar", ...]
        which has one too few spaces; this method simply changes the one
        space to two.
        ''_handle_long_word(chunks : [string],
                             cur_line : [string],
                             cur_len : int, width : int)

        Handle a chunk of text (most likely a word, not whitespace) that
        is too long to fit in any line.
        ''_wrap_chunks(chunks : [string]) -> [string]

        Wrap a sequence of text chunks and return a list of lines of
        length 'self.width' or less.  (If 'break_long_words' is false,
        some lines may be longer than this.)  Chunks correspond roughly
        to words and the whitespace between them: each chunk is
        indivisible (modulo 'break_long_words'), but a line break can
        come between any two chunks.  Chunks should not have internal
        whitespace; ie. a chunk is either all whitespace or a "word".
        Whitespace chunks will be removed from the beginning and end of

    A reentrant lock must be released by the thread that acquired it. Once a
    thread has acquired a reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it again
    without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it has
    acquired it.

    ''This class implements reentrant lock objects.

    A reentrant lock must be released by the thread that acquired it. Once a
    thread has acquired a reentrant lock, the same thread may acquire it
    again without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it
    has acquired it.

    ''<%s %s.%s object owner=%r count=%d at %s>''Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock,
        increment the recursion level by one, and return immediately. Otherwise,
        if another thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked. Once
        the lock is unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set
        the recursion level to one, and return. If more than one thread is
        blocked waiting until the lock is unlocked, only one at a time will be
        able to grab ownership of the lock. There is no return value in this
        case.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to true, do the same thing
        as when called without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to false, do not block. If a
        call without an argument would block, return false immediately;
        otherwise, do the same thing as when called without arguments, and
        return true.

        When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive
        value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout
        and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  Return true if the lock has
        been acquired, false if the timeout has elapsed.

        ''Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level.

        If after the decrement it is zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned
        by any thread), and if any other threads are blocked waiting for the
        lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed. If after
        the decrement the recursion level is still nonzero, the lock remains
        locked and owned by the calling thread.

        Only call this method when the calling thread owns the lock. A
        RuntimeError is raised if this method is called when the lock is
        unlocked.

        There is no return value.

        ''Class that implements a condition variable.

    A condition variable allows one or more threads to wait until they are
    notified by another thread.

    If the lock argument is given and not None, it must be a Lock or RLock
    object, and it is used as the underlying lock. Otherwise, a new RLock object
    is created and used as the underlying lock.

    ''<Condition(%s, %d)>''Wait until notified or until a timeout occurs.

        If the calling thread has not acquired the lock when this method is
        called, a RuntimeError is raised.

        This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is
        awakened by a notify() or notify_all() call for the same condition
        variable in another thread, or until the optional timeout occurs. Once
        awakened or timed out, it re-acquires the lock and returns.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        When the underlying lock is an RLock, it is not released using its
        release() method, since this may not actually unlock the lock when it
        was acquired multiple times recursively. Instead, an internal interface
        of the RLock class is used, which really unlocks it even when it has
        been recursively acquired several times. Another internal interface is
        then used to restore the recursion level when the lock is reacquired.

        ''Wait until a condition evaluates to True.

        predicate should be a callable which result will be interpreted as a
        boolean value.  A timeout may be provided giving the maximum time to
        wait.

        ''Wake up one or more threads waiting on this condition, if any.

        This method is deprecated, use notify_all() instead.

        ''notifyAll() is deprecated, use notify_all() instead''This class implements semaphore objects.

    Semaphores manage a counter representing the number of release() calls minus
    the number of acquire() calls, plus an initial value. The acquire() method
    blocks if necessary until it can return without making the counter
    negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

    ''semaphore initial value must be >= 0'': value=''Acquire a semaphore, decrementing the internal counter by one.

        When invoked without arguments: if the internal counter is larger than
        zero on entry, decrement it by one and return immediately. If it is zero
        on entry, block, waiting until some other thread has called release() to
        make it larger than zero. This is done with proper interlocking so that
        if multiple acquire() calls are blocked, release() will wake exactly one
        of them up. The implementation may pick one at random, so the order in
        which blocked threads are awakened should not be relied on. There is no
        return value in this case.

        When invoked with blocking set to true, do the same thing as when called
        without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with blocking set to false, do not block. If a call without
        an argument would block, return false immediately; otherwise, do the
        same thing as when called without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with a timeout other than None, it will block for at
        most timeout seconds.  If acquire does not complete successfully in
        that interval, return false.  Return true otherwise.

        ''can't specify timeout for non-blocking acquire''Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one or more.

        When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
        to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.

        ''n must be one or more''Implements a bounded semaphore.

    A bounded semaphore checks to make sure its current value doesn't exceed its
    initial value. If it does, ValueError is raised. In most situations
    semaphores are used to guard resources with limited capacity.

    If the semaphore is released too many times it's a sign of a bug. If not
    given, value defaults to 1.

    Like regular semaphores, bounded semaphores manage a counter representing
    the number of release() calls minus the number of acquire() calls, plus an
    initial value. The acquire() method blocks if necessary until it can return
    without making the counter negative. If not given, value defaults to 1.

    ''Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one or more.

        When the counter is zero on entry and another thread is waiting for it
        to become larger than zero again, wake up that thread.

        If the number of releases exceeds the number of acquires,
        raise a ValueError.

        ''Semaphore released too many times''Class implementing event objects.

    Events manage a flag that can be set to true with the set() method and reset
    to false with the clear() method. The wait() method blocks until the flag is
    true.  The flag is initially false.

    ''Return true if and only if the internal flag is true.''Return true if and only if the internal flag is true.

        This method is deprecated, use is_set() instead.

        ''isSet() is deprecated, use is_set() instead''Set the internal flag to true.

        All threads waiting for it to become true are awakened. Threads
        that call wait() once the flag is true will not block at all.

        ''Reset the internal flag to false.

        Subsequently, threads calling wait() will block until set() is called to
        set the internal flag to true again.

        ''Block until the internal flag is true.

        If the internal flag is true on entry, return immediately. Otherwise,
        block until another thread calls set() to set the flag to true, or until
        the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        This method returns the internal flag on exit, so it will always return
        True except if a timeout is given and the operation times out.

        ''signaled''Implements a Barrier.

    Useful for synchronizing a fixed number of threads at known synchronization
    points.  Threads block on 'wait()' and are simultaneously awoken once they
    have all made that call.

    ''A class that represents a thread of control.

    This class can be safely subclassed in a limited fashion. There are two ways
    to specify the activity: by passing a callable object to the constructor, or
    by overriding the run() method in a subclass.

    ''This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. Arguments are:

        *group* should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup
        class is implemented.

        *target* is the callable object to be invoked by the run()
        method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.

        *name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of
        the form "Thread-N" where N is a small decimal number.

        *args* is a list or tuple of arguments for the target invocation. Defaults to ().

        *kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target
        invocation. Defaults to {}.

        If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke
        the base class constructor (Thread.__init__()) before doing anything
        else to the thread.

        ''Thread-%d''daemon threads are disabled in this (sub)interpreter''Thread.__init__() was not called'' daemon'' %s''Start the thread's activity.

        same thread object.

        ''thread.__init__() not called''threads can only be started once''Method representing the thread's activity.

        You may override this method in a subclass. The standard run() method
        invokes the callable object passed to the object's constructor as the

        the underlying thread state (see pystate.h) gets deleted.
        ''Remove current thread from the dict of currently running threads.''Wait until the thread terminates.

        This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is
        called terminates -- either normally or through an unhandled exception
        or until the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call
        is_alive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the
        thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.

        When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will
        block until the thread terminates.

        A thread can be join()ed many times.

        join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current
        thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a

    ''Token constants.''tok_name''ISTERMINAL''ISNONTERMINAL''ISEOF'':=''Tokenization help for Python programs.

tokenize(readline) is a generator that breaks a stream of bytes into
Python tokens.  It decodes the bytes according to PEP-0263 for
determining source file encoding.

It accepts a readline-like method which is called repeatedly to get the
next line of input (or b"" for EOF).  It generates 5-tuples with these
members:

    the token type (see token.py)
    the token (a string)
    the starting (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the ending (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the original line (string)

It is designed to match the working of the Python tokenizer exactly, except
that it produces COMMENT tokens for comments and gives type OP for all

    It returns a bytes object, encoded using the ENCODING

    The detect_encoding() function is used to detect the encoding that should
    be used to decode a Python source file.  It requires one argument, readline,
    in the same way as the tokenize() generator.

    It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
    (as a string) and a list of any lines (left as bytes) it has read in.

    It detects the encoding from the presence of a utf-8 bom or an encoding
    cookie as specified in pep-0263.  If both a bom and a cookie are present,
    but disagree, a SyntaxError will be raised.  If the encoding cookie is an
    invalid charset, raise a SyntaxError.  Note that if a utf-8 bom is found,
    'utf-8-sig' is returned.

    If no encoding is specified, then the default of 'utf-8' will be returned.

    The tokenize() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects.  Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as bytes.  Alternatively, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile, 'rb').__next__  # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found.  The line passed is the
    physical line.

    The first token sequence will always be an ENCODING token
    which tells you which encoding was used to decode the bytes stream.

    This is useful for alternate formatting of stack traces.  If

    stack trace; (3) if type is SyntaxError and value has the

    The msg argument is a human-readable error message, e.g.::

    '' is not valid as type argument''Plain '' Got ''Internal helper for munging collections.abc.Callable's __args__.

    The canonical representation for a Callable's __args__ flattens the
    argument types, see https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/86361.

    For example::

        >>> import collections.abc
        >>> P = ParamSpec('P')
        >>> collections.abc.Callable[[int, int], str].__args__ == (int, int, str)
        True
        >>> collections.abc.Callable[P, str].__args__ == (P, str)
        True

    As a result, if we need to reconstruct the Callable from its __args__,
    we need to unflatten it.

    If obj is a type, we return a shorter version than the default

    But this would make users of this mixin duck type-compatible with

    Luckily, we can instead prevent iteration by setting __iter__ to None, which

    ''_getitem''Cannot subclass ''Cannot instantiate '' cannot be used with isinstance()'' cannot be used with issubclass()''typing.Any cannot be used with isinstance()''Special type indicating an unconstrained type.

    - Any is compatible with every type.
    - Any assumed to have all methods.
    - All values assumed to be instances of Any.

    Note that all the above statements are true from the point of view of
    static type checkers. At runtime, Any should not be used with instance
    checks.
    ''Any cannot be instantiated''Special type indicating functions that never return.

    Example::

        from typing import NoReturn

        def stop() -> NoReturn:
            raise Exception('no way')

    NoReturn can also be used as a bottom type, a type that
    has no values. Starting in Python 3.11, the Never type should
    be used for this concept instead. Type checkers should treat the two
    equivalently.
    '' is not subscriptable''The bottom type, a type that has no members.

    This can be used to define a function that should never be
    called, or a function that never returns::

    Only string literals and other LiteralStrings are compatible
    with LiteralString. This provides a tool to help prevent

    ''Special type construct to mark class variables.

    An annotation wrapped in ClassVar indicates that a given
    attribute is intended to be used as a class variable and
    should not be set on instances of that class.

    Usage::

        class Starship:
            stats: ClassVar[dict[str, int]] = {} # class variable
            damage: int = 10                     # instance variable

    ClassVar accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.

    Note that ClassVar is not a class itself, and should not
    be used with isinstance() or issubclass().
    '' accepts only single type.''Special typing construct to indicate final names to type checkers.

    A final name cannot be re-assigned or overridden in a subclass.

    For example::

        MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
        MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker

        class Connection:
            TIMEOUT: Final[int] = 10

        class FastConnector(Connection):
            TIMEOUT = 1  # Error reported by type checker

    There is no runtime checking of these properties.
    ''Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

    On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
    can also be used to denote unions;
    X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

    To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
    - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
    - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
      type(None).
    - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

        assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

    - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

        assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

    - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

        assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

    - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

        assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

    - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
    - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
    ''Cannot take a Union of no types.''Union[arg, ...]: each arg must be a type.''Used from the C implementation of TypeVar.

    TypeVar.__or__ calls this instead of returning types.UnionType
    because we want to allow unions between TypeVars and strings
    (forward references).
    ''Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].'' requires a single type.''Special typing form to define literal types (a.k.a. value types).

    This form can be used to indicate to type checkers that the corresponding
    variable or function parameter has a value equivalent to the provided
    literal (or one of several literals)::

        def validate_simple(data: Any) -> Literal[True]:  # always returns True
            ...

        MODE = Literal['r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb']
        def open_helper(file: str, mode: MODE) -> str:
            ...

        open_helper('/some/path', 'r')  # Passes type check
        open_helper('/other/path', 'typo')  # Error in type checker

    Literal[...] cannot be subclassed. At runtime, an arbitrary value
    is allowed as type argument to Literal[...], but type checkers may
    impose restrictions.
    ''Special form for marking type aliases.

    Use TypeAlias to indicate that an assignment should
    be recognized as a proper type alias definition by type
    checkers.

    For example::

        Predicate: TypeAlias = Callable[..., bool]

    It's invalid when used anywhere except as in the example above.
    ''Special form for annotating higher-order functions.

    ``Concatenate`` can be used in conjunction with ``ParamSpec`` and
    ``Callable`` to represent a higher-order function which adds, removes or
    transforms the parameters of a callable.

    For example::

        Callable[Concatenate[int, P], int]

    See PEP 612 for detailed information.
    ''Cannot take a Concatenate of no types.''The last parameter to Concatenate should be a ParamSpec variable or ellipsis.''Concatenate[arg, ...]: each arg must be a type.''Special typing construct for marking user-defined type guard functions.

    ``TypeGuard`` can be used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
    type guard function.  ``TypeGuard`` only accepts a single type argument.
    At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean.

    ``TypeGuard`` aims to benefit *type narrowing* -- a technique used by static
    type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
    program's code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
    conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
    conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a "type guard".

    Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
    as a type guard.  Such a function should use ``TypeGuard[...]`` as its
    return type to alert static type checkers to this intention.

    Using  ``-> TypeGuard`` tells the static type checker that for a given
    function:

    1. The return value is a boolean.
    2. If the return value is ``True``, the type of its argument
       is the type inside ``TypeGuard``.

    For example::

         def is_str_list(val: list[object]) -> TypeGuard[list[str]]:
             '''Determines whether all objects in the list are strings'''
             return all(isinstance(x, str) for x in val)

         def func1(val: list[object]):
             if is_str_list(val):
                 # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``list[str]``.
                 print(" ".join(val))
             else:
                 # Type of ``val`` remains as ``list[object]``.
                 print("Not a list of strings!")

    Strict type narrowing is not enforced -- ``TypeB`` need not be a narrower
    form of ``TypeA`` (it can even be a wider form) and this may lead to
    type-unsafe results.  The main reason is to allow for things like
    narrowing ``list[object]`` to ``list[str]`` even though the latter is not
    a subtype of the former, since ``list`` is invariant.  The responsibility of
    writing type-safe type guards is left to the user.

    ``TypeGuard`` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
    PEP 647 (User-Defined Type Guards).

    are wrappers around builtin collections and ABCs in collections.abc. These must

    The type unpack operator takes the child types from some container type,
    such as `tuple[int, str]` or a `TypeVarTuple`, and 'pulls them out'.

    For example::

        # For some generic class `Foo`:
        Foo[Unpack[tuple[int, str]]]  # Equivalent to Foo[int, str]

        Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
        # Specifies that `Bar` is generic in an arbitrary number of types.
        # (Think of `Ts` as a tuple of an arbitrary number of individual
        #  `TypeVar`s, which the `Unpack` is 'pulling out' directly into the
        #  `Generic[]`.)
        class Bar(Generic[Unpack[Ts]]): ...
        Bar[int]  # Valid
        Bar[int, str]  # Also valid

    From Python 3.11, this can also be done using the `*` operator::

        Foo[*tuple[int, str]]
        class Bar(Generic[*Ts]): ...

    And from Python 3.12, it can be done using built-in syntax for generics::

        Foo[*tuple[int, str]]
        class Bar[*Ts]: ...

    The operator can also be used along with a `TypedDict` to annotate
    `**kwargs` in a function signature::

        class Movie(TypedDict):
            name: str
            year: int

        # This function expects two keyword arguments - *name* of type `str` and
        # *year* of type `int`.
        def foo(**kwargs: Unpack[Movie]): ...

    Note that there is only some runtime checking of this operator. Not
    everything the runtime allows may be accepted by static type checkers.

    Such classes are primarily used with static type checkers that recognize
    structural subtyping (static duck-typing).

    For example::

        class C:
            def meth(self) -> int:
                return 0

        def func(x: Proto) -> int:
            return x.meth()

        func(C())  # Passes static type check

    See PEP 544 for details. Protocol classes decorated with
    @typing.runtime_checkable act as simple-minded runtime protocols that check
    only the presence of given attributes, ignoring their type signatures.
    Protocol classes can be generic, they are defined as::

    ''Runtime representation of an annotated type.

    At its core 'Annotated[t, dec1, dec2, ...]' is an alias for the type 't'
    with extra annotations. The alias behaves like a normal typing alias.
    Instantiating is the same as instantiating the underlying type; binding
    it to types is also the same.

    The metadata itself is stored in a '__metadata__' attribute as a tuple.
    ''typing.Annotated[{}, {}]''Add context-specific metadata to a type.

    Example: Annotated[int, runtime_check.Unsigned] indicates to the
    hypothetical runtime_check module that this type is an unsigned int.
    Every other consumer of this type can ignore this metadata and treat
    this type as int.

    The first argument to Annotated must be a valid type.

    Details:

    - It's an error to call `Annotated` with less than two arguments.
    - Access the metadata via the ``__metadata__`` attribute::

        assert Annotated[int, '$'].__metadata__ == ('$',)

    - Nested Annotated types are flattened::

        assert Annotated[Annotated[T, Ann1, Ann2], Ann3] == Annotated[T, Ann1, Ann2, Ann3]

    - Instantiating an annotated type is equivalent to instantiating the
    underlying type::

        assert Annotated[C, Ann1](5) == C(5)

    - Annotated can be used as a generic type alias::

        type Optimized[T] = Annotated[T, runtime.Optimize()]
        # type checker will treat Optimized[int]
        # as equivalent to Annotated[int, runtime.Optimize()]

        type OptimizedList[T] = Annotated[list[T], runtime.Optimize()]
        # type checker will treat OptimizedList[int]
        # as equivalent to Annotated[list[int], runtime.Optimize()]

    - Annotated cannot be used with an unpacked TypeVarTuple::

        type Variadic[*Ts] = Annotated[*Ts, Ann1]  # NOT valid

      This would be equivalent to::

        Annotated[T1, T2, T3, ..., Ann1]

      where T1, T2 etc. are TypeVars, which would be invalid, because
      only one type should be passed to Annotated.

    Such protocol can be used with isinstance() and issubclass().
    Raise TypeError if applied to a non-protocol class.
    This allows a simple-minded structural check very similar to
    one trick ponies in collections.abc such as Iterable.

    For example::

        @runtime_checkable
        class Closable(Protocol):
            def close(self): ...

        assert isinstance(open('/some/file'), Closable)

    not their type signatures!
    ''@runtime_checkable can be only applied to protocol classes, got %r''Failed to determine whether protocol member '' is a method member''Cast a value to a type.

    This returns the value unchanged.  To the type checker this
    signals that the return value has the designated type, but at
    runtime we intentionally don't check anything (we want this
    to be as fast as possible).
    ''Ask a static type checker to confirm that the value is of the given type.

    At runtime this does nothing: it returns the first argument unchanged with no
    checks or side effects, no matter the actual type of the argument.

    When a static type checker encounters a call to assert_type(), it
    emits an error if the value is not of the specified type::

        def greet(name: str) -> None:
            assert_type(name, str)  # OK
            assert_type(name, int)  # type checker error
    ''Return type hints for an object.

    This is often the same as obj.__annotations__, but it handles
    forward references encoded as string literals and recursively replaces all
    'Annotated[T, ...]' with 'T' (unless 'include_extras=True').

    The argument may be a module, class, method, or function. The annotations
    are returned as a dictionary. For classes, annotations include also
    inherited members.

    TypeError is raised if the argument is not of a type that can contain
    annotations, and an empty dictionary is returned if no annotations are
    present.

    BEWARE -- the behavior of globalns and localns is counterintuitive
    (unless you are familiar with how eval() and exec() work).  The
    search order is locals first, then globals.

    - If no dict arguments are passed, an attempt is made to use the
      globals from obj (or the respective module's globals for classes),
      and these are also used as the locals.  If the object does not appear
      to have globals, an empty dictionary is used.  For classes, the search
      order is globals first then locals.

    - If one dict argument is passed, it is used for both globals and
      locals.

    - If two dict arguments are passed, they specify globals and
      locals, respectively.

    If a type checker finds that a call to assert_never() is
    reachable, it will emit an error.

    At runtime, this throws an exception when called.
    ''Expected code to be unreachable, but got: ''Decorator to indicate that annotations are not type hints.

    In a stub file, place two or more stub definitions for the same

    For example::

        @overload
        def utf8(value: bytes) -> bytes: ...

    In a non-stub file (i.e. a regular .py file), do the same but
    follow it with an implementation.  The implementation should *not*
    be decorated with @overload::

        @overload

    Use this decorator to indicate to type checkers that the decorated

    For example::

        class Base:
            @final
            def done(self) -> None:
                ...

        class Other(Leaf):  # Error reported by type checker

    There is no runtime checking of these properties. The decorator
    attempts to set the ``__final__`` attribute to ``True`` on the decorated
    object to allow runtime introspection.
    ''KT''VT''T_co''V_co''VT_co''T_contra''CT_co''Deprecated alias to collections.abc.Callable.

    Callable[[int], str] signifies a function that takes a single
    parameter of type int and returns a str.

    The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
    values: the argument list and the return type.
    The argument list must be a list of types, a ParamSpec,
    Concatenate or ellipsis. The return type must be a single type.

    There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
    such function types are rarely used as callback types.
    ''Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

    Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

    Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
    to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
    of an int, a float and a string.

    To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].
    ''Deprecated alias to builtins.type.

    builtins.type or typing.Type can be used to annotate class objects.
    For example, suppose we have the following classes::

        class User: ...  # Abstract base for User classes
        class BasicUser(User): ...
        class ProUser(User): ...
        class TeamUser(User): ...

    And a function that takes a class argument that's a subclass of
    User and returns an instance of the corresponding class::

        def new_user[U](user_class: Type[U]) -> U:
            user = user_class()
            # (Here we could write the user object to a database)
            return user

        joe = new_user(BasicUser)

    At this point the type checker knows that joe has type BasicUser.

    Usage::

        class Employee(NamedTuple):

            id: int

    This is equivalent to::

        Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id'])

    The resulting class has an extra __annotations__ attribute, giving a
    dict that maps field names to types.  (The field names are also in
    the _fields attribute, which is part of the namedtuple API.)
    An alternative equivalent functional syntax is also accepted::

        Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', [('name', str), ('id', int)])
    ''Either list of fields or keywords can be provided to NamedTuple, not both''Create a new typed dict class object.

        This method is called when TypedDict is subclassed,
        or when TypedDict is instantiated. This way
        TypedDict supports all three syntax forms described in its docstring.
        Subclasses and instances of TypedDict return actual dictionaries.

At runtime it is equivalent to a plain dict.

    TypedDict creates a dictionary type such that a type checker will expect all
    instances to have a certain set of keys, where each key is
    associated with a value of a consistent type. This expectation
    is not checked at runtime.

    Usage::

        >>> class Point2D(TypedDict):
        ...     x: int
        ...     y: int
        ...     label: str
        ...
        >>> a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
        >>> b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check
        >>> Point2D(x=1, y=2, label='first') == dict(x=1, y=2, label='first')
        True

    The type info can be accessed via the Point2D.__annotations__ dict, and
    the Point2D.__required_keys__ and Point2D.__optional_keys__ frozensets.
    TypedDict supports an additional equivalent form::

        Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': str})

    By default, all keys must be present in a TypedDict. It is possible
    to override this by specifying totality::

        class Point2D(TypedDict, total=False):
            x: int
            y: int

    This means that a Point2D TypedDict can have any of the keys omitted. A type
    checker is only expected to support a literal False or True as the value of
    the total argument. True is the default, and makes all items defined in the
    class body be required.

    The Required and NotRequired special forms can also be used to mark
    individual keys as being required or not required::

        class Point2D(TypedDict):
            x: int               # the "x" key must always be present (Required is the default)
            y: NotRequired[int]  # the "y" key can be omitted

    See PEP 655 for more details on Required and NotRequired.
    ''TypedDict takes either a dict or keyword arguments, but not both''The kwargs-based syntax for TypedDict definitions is deprecated in Python 3.11, will be removed in Python 3.13, and may not be understood by third-party type checkers.''Special typing construct to mark a TypedDict key as required.

    This is mainly useful for total=False TypedDicts.

    For example::

        class Movie(TypedDict, total=False):
            title: Required[str]
            year: int

        m = Movie(
            title='The Matrix',  # typechecker error if key is omitted
            year=1999,
        )

    There is no runtime checking that a required key is actually provided
    when instantiating a related TypedDict.
    '' accepts only a single type.''Special typing construct to mark a TypedDict key as potentially missing.

    For example::

        class Movie(TypedDict):
            title: str
            year: NotRequired[int]

        m = Movie(

        )
    ''NewType creates simple unique types with almost zero runtime overhead.

    NewType(name, tp) is considered a subtype of tp
    by static type checkers. At runtime, NewType(name, tp) returns
    a dummy callable that simply returns its argument.

    Usage::

        UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

        def name_by_id(user_id: UserId) -> str:
            ...

        UserId('user')          # Fails type check

        name_by_id(42)          # Fails type check
        name_by_id(UserId(42))  # OK

        num = UserId(5) + 1     # type: int

    append-only, unbuffered).  The TextIO and BinaryIO subclasses
    below capture the distinctions between text vs. binary, which is
    pervasive in the interface; however we currently do not offer a
    way to track the other distinctions in the type system.

        reveal_type(x)

    Running a static type checker (e.g., mypy) on this example
    will produce output similar to 'Revealed type is "builtins.int"'.

    The decorator can be applied to a function, class, or metaclass.

    Example usage with a decorator function::

        @dataclass_transform()
        def create_model[T](cls: type[T]) -> type[T]:
            ...
            return cls

        @create_model
        class CustomerModel:
            id: int
            name: str

    On a base class::

        @dataclass_transform()
        class ModelBase: ...

        class CustomerModel(ModelBase):
            id: int
            name: str

    On a metaclass::

        @dataclass_transform()
        class ModelMeta(type): ...

        class ModelBase(metaclass=ModelMeta): ...

        class CustomerModel(ModelBase):
            id: int
            name: str

    The ``CustomerModel`` classes defined above will
    be treated by type checkers similarly to classes created with
    ``@dataclasses.dataclass``.
    For example, type checkers will assume these classes have
    ``__init__`` methods that accept ``id`` and ``name``.

    The arguments to this decorator can be used to customize this behavior:
    - ``eq_default`` indicates whether the ``eq`` parameter is assumed to be
        ``True`` or ``False`` if it is omitted by the caller.
    - ``order_default`` indicates whether the ``order`` parameter is
        assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
    - ``kw_only_default`` indicates whether the ``kw_only`` parameter is
        assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
    - ``frozen_default`` indicates whether the ``frozen`` parameter is
        assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
    - ``field_specifiers`` specifies a static list of supported classes
        or functions that describe fields, similar to ``dataclasses.field()``.
    - Arbitrary other keyword arguments are accepted in order to allow for
        possible future extensions.

    At runtime, this decorator records its arguments in the
    ``__dataclass_transform__`` attribute on the decorated object.
    It has no other runtime effect.

    See PEP 681 for more details.
    ''Indicate that a method is intended to override a method in a base class.

    Usage::

        class Base:
            def method(self) -> None:

            @override
            def method(self) -> None:
                super().method()

    When this decorator is applied to a method, the type checker will
    validate that it overrides a method or attribute with the same name on a
    base class.  This helps prevent bugs that may occur when a base class is
    changed without an equivalent change to a child class.

    There is no runtime checking of this property. The decorator attempts to
    set the ``__override__`` attribute to ``True`` on the decorated object to
    allow runtime introspection.

    its activity until the new process if fully registered (this is needed to
    prevent a race condition in some implementations).

    Notes:
        Implementations of this class must be thread-safe.

    interfere with any processes launched outside the event loop, and scales
    linearly with the number of subprocesses launched by the event loop. The
    main disadvantage is that pidfds are specific to Linux, and only work on

    NOTE: This function is meant to accommodate an unusual case; one

    WARNING: Using this function to disable the check can lead to
    unexpected behavior and even crashes.  It should only be used during
    extension module development.

    If "disable_check" is True then the compatibility check will not
    happen while the context manager is active.  Otherwise the check
    *will* happen.

    Normally, extensions that do not support multiple interpreters
    may not be imported in a subinterpreter.  That implies modules
    that do not implement multi-phase init or that explicitly of out.

    Likewise for modules import in a subinterpeter with its own GIL
    when the extension does not support a per-interpreter GIL.  This
    implies the module does not have a Py_mod_multiple_interpreters slot
    set to Py_MOD_PER_INTERPRETER_GIL_SUPPORTED.

    In both cases, this context manager may be used to temporarily
    disable the check for compatible extension modules.

    You can get the same effect as this function by implementing the
    basic interface of multi-phase init (PEP 489) and lying about

    ''zipimport provides support for importing Python modules from Zip archives.

This module exports three objects:
- zipimporter: a class; its constructor takes a path to a Zip archive.
- ZipImportError: exception raised by zipimporter objects. It's a
  subclass of ImportError, so it can be caught as ImportError, too.
- _zip_directory_cache: a dict, mapping archive paths to zip directory
  info dicts, as used in zipimporter._files.

It is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is
used by the builtin import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths
to Zip archives.
''ZipImportError''zipimporter(archivepath) -> zipimporter object

    Create a new zipimporter instance. 'archivepath' must be a path to
    a zipfile, or to a specific path inside a zipfile. For example, it can be
    '/tmp/myimport.zip', or '/tmp/myimport.zip/mydirectory', if mydirectory is a
    valid directory inside the archive.

    'ZipImportError is raised if 'archivepath' doesn't point to a valid Zip
    archive.

    The 'archive' attribute of zipimporter objects contains the name of the
    zipfile targeted.

        ''get_source(fullname) -> source string.

        Return the source code for the specified module. Raise ZipImportError
        if the module couldn't be found, return None if the archive does

    A pathlib-compatible interface for zip files.

    Consider a zip file with this structure::

        .
         a.txt
         b
             c.txt
             d
                 e.txt

    >>> data = io.BytesIO()
    >>> zf = ZipFile(data, 'w')
    >>> zf.writestr('a.txt', 'content of a')
    >>> zf.writestr('b/c.txt', 'content of c')
    >>> zf.writestr('b/d/e.txt', 'content of e')
    >>> zf.filename = 'mem/abcde.zip'

    Path accepts the zipfile object itself or a filename

    >>> root = Path(zf)

    From there, several path operations are available.

    Directory iteration (including the zip file itself):

    >>> a, b = root.iterdir()
    >>> a
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'a.txt')
    >>> b
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'b/')

    name property:

    >>> b.name
    'b'

    join with divide operator:

    >>> c = b / 'c.txt'
    >>> c
    Path('mem/abcde.zip', 'b/c.txt')
    >>> c.name
    'c.txt'

    Read text:

    >>> c.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
    'content of c'

    existence:

    >>> c.exists()
    True
    >>> (b / 'missing.txt').exists()
    False

    Coercion to string:

    >>> import os
    >>> str(c).replace(os.sep, posixpath.sep)
    'mem/abcde.zip/b/c.txt'

    At the root, ``name``, ``filename``, and ``parent``
    resolve to the zipfile. Note these attributes are not
    valid and will raise a ``ValueError`` if the zipfile
    has no filename.

    >>> root.name
    'abcde.zip'
    >>> str(root.filename).replace(os.sep, posixpath.sep)
    'mem/abcde.zip'

import unittest

class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.widget = Widget('The widget')

    def test_default_widget_size(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.widget.size(), (50,50),
                         'incorrect default size')

    def test_widget_resize(self):
        self.widget.resize(100,150)
        self.assertEqual(self.widget.size(), (100,150),
                         'wrong size after resize')
Note The order in which the various tests will be run is determined by sorting the test method names with respect to the built-in ordering for strings.
If the setUp() method raises an exception while the test is running, the framework will consider the test to have suffered an error, and the test method will not be executed.

Similarly, we can provide a tearDown() method that tidies up after the test method has been run:

import unittest

class WidgetTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.widget = Widget('The widget')

    def tearDown(self):
        self.widget.dispose()
If setUp() succeeded, tearDown() will be run whether the test method succeeded or not.

Such a working environment for the testing code is called a test fixture. A new TestCase instance is created as a unique test fixture used to execute each individual test method. Thus setUp(), tearDown(), and __init__() will be called once per test.

It is recommended that you use TestCase implementations to group tests together according to the features they test. unittest provides a mechanism for this: the test suite, represented by unittests TestSuite class. In most cases, calling unittest.main() will do the right thing and collect all the modules test cases for you and execute them.

However, should you want to customize the building of your test suite, you can do it yourself:

def suite():
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase('test_default_widget_size'))
    suite.addTest(WidgetTestCase('test_widget_resize'))
    return suite

if __name__ == '__main__':
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())

Convert a function to be a static method.

A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
To declare a static method, use this idiom:

     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f(arg1, arg2, argN):
             ...

It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()). Both the class and the instance are ignored, and
neither is passed implicitly as the first argument to the method.

Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++.

Convert a function to be a class method.

A class method receives the class as implicit first argument,

To declare a class method, use this idiom:

  class C:

It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance

int(x, base=10) -> integer

Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating point
numbers, this truncates towards zero.

If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
given base.  The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
by whitespace.  The base defaults to 10.  Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.

interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom

stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

last_exc - the last uncaught exception
  Only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.
last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception

encoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be
decoded or encoded with. It defaults to locale.getencoding().

errors determines the strictness of encoding and decoding (see
help(codecs.Codec) or the documentation for codecs.register) and
defaults to "strict".

newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',
'\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as follows:

* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.

If line_buffering is True, a call to flush is implied when a call to
write contains a newline character.''TextIOWrapper.closed''TextIOWrapper.errors''TextIOWrapper.name''TextIOWrapper.newlines''Base class for text I/O.

This class provides a character and line based interface to stream
I/O. There is no readinto method because Python's character strings
are immutable.

''_TextIOBase.newlines''_IOBase.__dict__''The abstract base class for all I/O classes.

This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
called.

The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
I/O classes work with str data.

Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.

IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
stream.

IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:

''Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged

Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!
''(Extremely) low-level import machinery bits as used by importlib.''A buffered reader and writer object together.

A buffered reader object and buffered writer object put together to
form a sequential IO object that can read and write. This is typically
used with a socket or two-way pipe.

reader and writer are RawIOBase objects that are readable and
writeable respectively. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.''BufferedRWPair.closed''Base class for buffered IO objects.

The main difference with RawIOBase is that the read() method
supports omitting the size argument, and does not have a default
implementation that defers to readinto().

In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
return None.

A typical implementation should not inherit from a RawIOBase
implementation, but wrap one.

The mode can be 'r' (default), 'w', 'x' or 'a' for reading,

doesn't exist when opened for writing or appending; it will be truncated
when opened for writing.  A FileExistsError will be raised if it already
exists when opened for creating. Opening a file for creating implies
writing so this mode behaves in a similar way to 'w'.Add a '+' to the mode
to allow simultaneous reading and writing. A custom opener can be used by
passing a callable as *opener*. The underlying file descriptor for the file
object is then obtained by calling opener with (*name*, *flags*).
*opener* must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener*

The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default
protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible
with previous versions.

Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.

The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single
bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary
writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets
this interface.

If *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try
to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python
2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
is None or smaller than 5.''Pickler.memo''Pickler.persistent_id''This takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.

The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
representation are ignored.

The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes
an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no
arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a
binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any
other custom object that meets this interface.

Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
string instances as bytes objects.''Unpickler.memo''Unpickler.persistent_load''Optimized C implementation for the Python pickle module.''Lib.email._policybase''Lib._py_abc''Lib._pydatetime''Lib._pydecimal''Random() -> create a random number generator with its own internal state.''Module implements the Mersenne Twister random number generator.''sha1.block_size''sha1.digest_size''sha1.name''SHA224Type.block_size''SHA224Type.digest_size''SHA224Type.name''SHA256Type.block_size''SHA256Type.digest_size''SHA256Type.name''SHA384Type.block_size''SHA384Type.digest_size''SHA384Type.name''SHA512Type.block_size''SHA512Type.digest_size''SHA512Type.name''HACL''sha3_224([data], *, usedforsecurity=True) -> SHA3 object

''Accelerators for the statistics module.
''string helper module''Struct(fmt) --> compiled struct object

''struct format string''Struct.format''struct size in bytes''Struct.size''Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.
''error.__weakref__''A lock object is a synchronization primitive.  To create a lock,
call threading.Lock().  Methods are:

acquire() -- lock the lock, possibly blocking until it can be obtained
release() -- unlock of the lock
locked() -- test whether the lock is currently locked

A lock is not owned by the thread that locked it; another thread may
unlock it.  A thread attempting to lock a lock that it has already locked
will block until another thread unlocks it.  Deadlocks may ensue.''ExceptHookArgs

Type used to pass arguments to threading.excepthook.''This module provides primitive operations to write multi-threaded programs.
The 'threading' module provides a more convenient interface.''Thread-local data''Lib._threading_local''Debug module to trace memory blocks allocated by Python.''Abstract base class for generic types.

On Python 3.12 and newer, generic classes implicitly inherit from
Generic when they declare a parameter list after the class's name::

    class Mapping[KT, VT]:
        def __getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:
            ...
        # Etc.

On older versions of Python, however, generic classes have to
explicitly inherit from Generic.

After a class has been declared to be generic, it can then be used as
follows::

    def lookup_name[KT, VT](mapping: Mapping[KT, VT], key: KT, default: VT) -> VT:
        try:
            return mapping[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default
''Parameter specification variable.

The preferred way to construct a parameter specification is via the
dedicated syntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases,
where the use of '**' creates a parameter specification::

    type IntFunc[**P] = Callable[P, int]

For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, ParamSpec objects
can also be created as follows::

    P = ParamSpec('P')

Parameter specification variables exist primarily for the benefit of
static type checkers.  They are used to forward the parameter types of
one callable to another callable, a pattern commonly found in
higher-order functions and decorators.  They are only valid when used
in ``Concatenate``, or as the first argument to ``Callable``, or as
parameters for user-defined Generics. See class Generic for more
information on generic types.

An example for annotating a decorator::

    def add_logging[**P, T](f: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
        '''A type-safe decorator to add logging to a function.'''
        def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
            logging.info(f'{f.__name__} was called')
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return inner

    @add_logging
    def add_two(x: float, y: float) -> float:
        '''Add two numbers together.'''
        return x + y

Parameter specification variables can be introspected. e.g.::

    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")
    >>> P.__name__
    'P'

Note that only parameter specification variables defined in the global
scope can be pickled.
''Represents positional arguments.''ParamSpec.args''Represents keyword arguments.''ParamSpec.kwargs''The args for a ParamSpec object.

Given a ParamSpec object P, P.args is an instance of ParamSpecArgs.

ParamSpecArgs objects have a reference back to their ParamSpec::

    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")
    >>> P.args.__origin__ is P
    True

This type is meant for runtime introspection and has no special meaning
to static type checkers.
''The kwargs for a ParamSpec object.

Given a ParamSpec object P, P.kwargs is an instance of ParamSpecKwargs.

ParamSpecKwargs objects have a reference back to their ParamSpec::

    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")
    >>> P.kwargs.__origin__ is P
    True

This type is meant for runtime introspection and has no special meaning
to static type checkers.
''Type alias.

Type aliases are created through the type statement::

    type Alias = int

In this example, Alias and int will be treated equivalently by static
type checkers.

At runtime, Alias is an instance of TypeAliasType. The __name__
attribute holds the name of the type alias. The value of the type alias
is stored in the __value__ attribute. It is evaluated lazily, so the
value is computed only if the attribute is accessed.

Type aliases can also be generic::

    type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]

In this case, the type parameters of the alias are stored in the
__type_params__ attribute.

See PEP 695 for more information.
''TypeAliasType.__module__''TypeAliasType.__parameters__''TypeAliasType.__type_params__''TypeAliasType.__value__''TypeVar.__bound__''TypeVar.__constraints__''Type variable.

The preferred way to construct a type variable is via the dedicated
syntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases::

    class Sequence[T]:  # T is a TypeVar
        ...

This syntax can also be used to create bound and constrained type
variables::

    # S is a TypeVar bound to str
    class StrSequence[S: str]:
        ...

    # A is a TypeVar constrained to str or bytes
    class StrOrBytesSequence[A: (str, bytes)]:
        ...

However, if desired, reusable type variables can also be constructed
manually, like so::

   T = TypeVar('T')  # Can be anything
   S = TypeVar('S', bound=str)  # Can be any subtype of str
   A = TypeVar('A', str, bytes)  # Must be exactly str or bytes

Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type
checkers.  They serve as the parameters for generic types as well
as for generic function and type alias definitions.

The variance of type variables is inferred by type checkers when they
are created through the type parameter syntax and when
``infer_variance=True`` is passed. Manually created type variables may
be explicitly marked covariant or contravariant by passing
``covariant=True`` or ``contravariant=True``. By default, manually
created type variables are invariant. See PEP 484 and PEP 695 for more
details.
''Type variable tuple. A specialized form of type variable that enables
variadic generics.

The preferred way to construct a type variable tuple is via the
dedicated syntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases,
where a single '*' indicates a type variable tuple::

    def move_first_element_to_last[T, *Ts](tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:
        return (*tup[1:], tup[0])

For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, TypeVarTuple objects
can also be created as follows::

    Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')  # Can be given any name

Just as a TypeVar (type variable) is a placeholder for a single type,
a TypeVarTuple is a placeholder for an *arbitrary* number of types. For
example, if we define a generic class using a TypeVarTuple::

    class C[*Ts]: ...

Then we can parameterize that class with an arbitrary number of type
arguments::

    C[int]       # Fine
    C[int, str]  # Also fine
    C[()]        # Even this is fine

For more details, see PEP 646.

Note that only TypeVarTuples defined in the global scope can be
pickled.

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

Cartesian product of input iterables.  Equivalent to nested for-loops.

For example, product(A, B) returns the same as:  ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).
The leftmost iterators are in the outermost for-loop, so the output tuples
cycle in a manner similar to an odometer (with the rightmost element changing
on every iteration).

To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number
of repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument. For example,
product(A, repeat=4) means the same as product(A, A, A, A).

product('ab', range(3)) --> ('a',0) ('a',1) ('a',2) ('b',0) ('b',1) ('b',2)

Return a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where
the i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument.  The .__next__()
method continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence
is exhausted and then it raises StopIteration.  When the shorter iterables
are exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place.  The fillvalue
defaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.

None, integers, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays,

It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
''The time value as returned by gmtime(), localtime(), and strptime(), and
 accepted by asctime(), mktime() and strftime().  May be considered as a
 sequence of 9 integers.

 Note that several fields' values are not the same as those defined by
 the C language standard for struct tm.  For example, the value of the
 field tm_year is the actual year, not year - 1900.  See individual
 fields' descriptions for details.''Atlantic Standard Time''Lib.asyncio.timeouts''Lib.token''Lib.tokenize''Lib.traceback''Lib.tracemalloc''Lib.asyncio.transports''Lib.asyncio.trsock''Lib.tty''Lib.types''Lib.typing''Lib.asyncio.unix_events''Lib.importlib.util''Lib.multiprocessing.util''Lib.unittest.util''Lib.email.utils''Lib.warnings''Lib.weakref''Lib.webbrowser''Lib.asyncio.windows_events''Lib.asyncio.windows_utils''PyHKEY Object - A Python object, representing a win32 registry key.

This object wraps a Windows HKEY object, automatically closing it when
the object is destroyed.  To guarantee cleanup, you can call either
the Close() method on the PyHKEY, or the CloseKey() method.

All functions which accept a handle object also accept an integer --
however, use of the handle object is encouraged.

Functions:
Close() - Closes the underlying handle.
Detach() - Returns the integer Win32 handle, detaching it from the object

Properties:
handle - The integer Win32 handle.

Operations:
__bool__ - Handles with an open object return true, otherwise false.
__int__ - Converting a handle to an integer returns the Win32 handle.
rich comparison - Handle objects are compared using the handle value.''This module provides access to the Windows registry API.

Functions:

CloseKey() - Closes a registry key.
ConnectRegistry() - Establishes a connection to a predefined registry handle
                    on another computer.
CreateKey() - Creates the specified key, or opens it if it already exists.
DeleteKey() - Deletes the specified key.
DeleteValue() - Removes a named value from the specified registry key.
EnumKey() - Enumerates subkeys of the specified open registry key.
EnumValue() - Enumerates values of the specified open registry key.
ExpandEnvironmentStrings() - Expand the env strings in a REG_EXPAND_SZ
                             string.
FlushKey() - Writes all the attributes of the specified key to the registry.
LoadKey() - Creates a subkey under HKEY_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and
            stores registration information from a specified file into that
            subkey.
OpenKey() - Opens the specified key.
OpenKeyEx() - Alias of OpenKey().
QueryValue() - Retrieves the value associated with the unnamed value for a
               specified key in the registry.
QueryValueEx() - Retrieves the type and data for a specified value name
                 associated with an open registry key.
QueryInfoKey() - Returns information about the specified key.
SaveKey() - Saves the specified key, and all its subkeys a file.
SetValue() - Associates a value with a specified key.
SetValueEx() - Stores data in the value field of an open registry key.

Special objects:

HKEYType -- type object for HKEY objects
error -- exception raised for Win32 errors

Integer constants:
Many constants are defined - see the documentation for each function
to see what constants are used, and where.''Lib.zipimport''1.3.1''Create a decompressor object for decompressing data incrementally.

  wbits = 15
  zdict
     The predefined compression dictionary. This is a sequence of bytes
     (such as a bytes object) containing subsequences that are expected
     to occur frequently in the data that is to be compressed. Those
     subsequences that are expected to be most common should come at the
     end of the dictionary. This must be the same dictionary as used by the
     compressor that produced the input data.

''The functions in this module allow compression and decompression using the
zlib library, which is based on GNU zip.

adler32(string[, start]) -- Compute an Adler-32 checksum.
compress(data[, level]) -- Compress data, with compression level 0-9 or -1.
compressobj([level[, ...]]) -- Return a compressor object.
crc32(string[, start]) -- Compute a CRC-32 checksum.
decompress(string,[wbits],[bufsize]) -- Decompresses a compressed string.
decompressobj([wbits[, zdict]]) -- Return a decompressor object.

'wbits' is window buffer size and container format.
Compressor objects support compress() and flush() methods; decompressor
objects support decompress() and flush().'Package unittestPackage rePackage asyncioPackage collectionsPackage concurrent.futuresPackage concurrentPackage multiprocessingPackage zipfile._pathPackage

{cmd} <name> ...
    Show text documentation on something.  <name> may be the name of a
    Python keyword, topic, function, module, or package, or a dotted
    reference to a class or function within a module or module in a
    package.  If <name> contains a '{sep}', it is used as the path to a
    Python source file to document. If name is 'keywords', 'topics',
    or 'modules', a listing of these things is displayed.

{cmd} -k <keyword>
    Search for a keyword in the synopsis lines of all available modules.

{cmd} -n <hostname>
    Start an HTTP server with the given hostname (default: localhost).

{cmd} -p <port>
    Start an HTTP server on the given port on the local machine.  Port
    number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.

{cmd} -b
    Start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and open a web browser
    to interactively browse documentation.  This option can be used in
    combination with -n and/or -p.

{cmd} -w <name> ...
    Write out the HTML documentation for a module to a file in the current
    directory.  If <name> contains a '{sep}', it is treated as a filename; if
    it names a directory, documentation is written for all the contents.
