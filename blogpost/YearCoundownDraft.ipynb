    "The issue that we had with Feb 29 involved us finding a day that only exists in one year, how about an hour that only exists in one year? 2:30 on Mar 9 2025 doesn't exist because of daylight savings. After 1:59, clocks immediately skip to 3:00. If we create a countdown exactly a year before then, python's datetime library does something odd: when it resolves 2:30 into a timezone which doesn't have that time, it shifts it down exactly an hour to 1:30. This behavior isn't incorrect, but it's not obvious and can lead to strange results."
